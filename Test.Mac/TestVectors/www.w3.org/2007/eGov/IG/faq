<h1>[DRAFT] Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about eGovernment at W3C </h1>
</div>

<p>eGovernment refers to the use of the Web or other information technologies
by governing bodies at different levels (local, state, national and
multi-national) to interact with their citizenry, between departments and
divisions, and between governments themselves. This FAQ answers some questions
about W3C's role in this space via its <a href="./"><abbr

<h2 id="q2">How does W3C contribute to eGovernment?</h2>

<p>The Web has become the main channel for governments to deliver services to
citizens and Web technologies are crucial in the relationships between
governments, and governments and industry. Following interoperable, open Web
standards helps ensure access to information by people with diverse
capabilities, using a broad range of devices supplied by any vendor of their
choice, and helps ensure that "the people's data" will remain available long
into the future. W3C has produced more than 90 Web standards in over 11 years.
Governments are increasingly finding value in Web standards created at W3C and
incorporating them into their policies.</p>

<h2 id="q3">What W3C technologies pertain to eGovernment?</h2>

<p>There are many, from HTML to build Web pages, to Semantic Web technologies
to increase metadata. Some of the most visible relate to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web Accessibility, which is used or referenced in laws and regulations in
    several countries; see the <a href="/WAI/policy-res">policy resources from
    WAI</a>, W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative.</li>
  <li>XML and Web Services, much used to develop eGovernment frameworks,
    architectures and services and improve interoperability between
  systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>The eGovernment Activity at W3C will identify any gaps to be filled in
creating a complete suite of standards to enable open government information
and ease the goal of linkable public sector Information.</p>

<h2 id="q4">Why is W3C launching this group now (June 2008)?</h2>

<p>W3C has been involved in eGovernment for several years already. P3P and WCAG
are good examples, and they were developed ten years ago already! The new group
is the culmination of several years of work by W3C in this area, including two
Workshops on eGovernment in 2007, <a
href="http://www.w3c.es/Eventos/2007/eGov/">one in Europe</a> and <a
href="/2007/eGov/eGov-policy">one in North America</a>. The new work will
address eGovernment needs specifically.</p>

<p>In the past, many government agencies developed services using proprietary
technologies or requiring the use of a given solution by the citizenry and
industry. However, governments are increasingly finding value in open Web
standards created at W3C, but sometimes they question the benefit due to the
considerable effort they have to spend in suiting them to their needs, in part
due to their unique requirements (e.g. to demand and enforce certain policies
about information privacy). So there is still work to do, including helping the
governments understand how to better use, support and participate in the
development of Web standards that fit their needs. W3C also needs to learn how
to communicate in terms used by government agencies.</p>

<p>This new forum provides a great opportunity to have requirements from all
eGovernment stakeholders influence W3C standards for the benefit of the larger
community.</p>

<h2 id="q6">How does W3C work relate to efforts in other organizations?</h2>

<p>One of the goals of this activity is to achieve collective outreach by
standards bodies, leading standards bodies working in fields that support
better government data integration and sharing. Therefore, the Interest Group
seeks to work closely with international organizations that deal with
eGovernment such as The World Bank, <abbr
title="Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr>,
<abbr title="Organization of American States">OAS</abbr>, United Nations,
European Commission, <abbr
title="Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards">OASIS</abbr>,
and others. In this collaboration, W3C will concentrate on what it does well
— standards development in a collaborative environment, and Web technology
expertise — and will work together with those bodies to promote use of open
standards and identify any gaps to be filled in creating a complete suite of
standards to enable open government information.</p>

<h2 id="q7">What are the expected outcomes?</h2>

<p>W3C has chartered a public eGovernment Interest Group with the goal of
improving access to government through better use of the Web. To reach that
goal, W3C plans to create a task force to address three main topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use of Open Standards </li>
  <li>Transparency and Openness </li>
  <li>Seamless Integration of Data </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/2008/02/eGov/ig-charter">group's charter</a> cites two types
of deliverables from these task forces:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The creation of an <strong>interdisciplinary forum</strong> for
    discussing how the use of open web standards can improve access to
    government.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong> of the challenges that were identified by
    the task forces, the technical and administrative approaches used, and the
    needs of best practices, guidelines or new technologies to be developed
    (roadmap) in order to tackle the most relevant issues within scope for each
    task force.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Interest Group may also propose holding more public Workshops to explore
new and emerging approaches.</p>

<h2 id="q8">How can I participate in W3C's eGovernment work? How much time will
participation require?</h2>

<p>Participation is open to the public; anyone may join the group. The
eGovernment IG is chartered for one year, and expected commitment for a
participants is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.5-hours for a <a href="./#telecon">teleconference</a> every other
  week</li>
  <li>1-2 <a href="./#f2f">face to face meetings</a> per year</li>
  <li>participation in the <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-egov-ig/">public mailing
    list</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please, see the <a href="./participation">separate page on participation</a>
to learn how to join the group.</p>

<h2>Wh<span id="q9"></span>at do government agencies typically see as the
benefits of using mashups? What kind of data are they using? What are the
challenges?</h2>

<p>Government agencies have not seriously considered mashups on a coordinated
level yet. The agencies are challenged with exposing data from applications or
creating applications to display data. Resourcing of personnel and funding have
not allowed for a focus on providing mashups (mashups defined as merging data
from two or more different applications or data sources and producing
comparative views of the combined information). The government agencies are
also challenged in finding other agencies or organizations where regulations or
government policy (in addition to the lack of resources) will allow the
sharing/exchange of information which would lead to a useful mashup. A typical
application mashup requires the use of APIs with data available via XML, many
agencies have not yet considered the consistent or holistic use of XML across
applications or data repositories, not to mention other open formats like RDF.
The age of systems varies significantly and, at times, the proprietary nature
of the systems and applications offers further challenges with providing access
to the data needed for a mashup.</p>

<p>It is often not within the mission of an agency to provide sets of
information from other agencies or different sources. A few third sector
organizations have taken government information and provided views into joined
data sources to meet public needs or other objectives which show the potential
these mashups could have. Unfortunately, these organizations have to use that
data in the way it's published, usually in HTML or in proprietary formats.</p>

<p>Developing information for the sole purpose of putting it on the Web as an
informative resource, although important and required by policies in many
cases, is not enough anymore when citizens and civil societies are asking for
access to the raw data. Publishing the raw data in open accessible formats
should be a new goal for the agencies and they should get enough incentive to
do so. Vast improvement of data integration between disparate systems and
flourishing of services are just some of the benefits the unexpected reuse of
that information would bring. This is not exempt from additional challenges
though.</p>

<p>Agencies are faced with having to ensure that the information and other data
that they provide remains the authoritative source of the information and data.
By providing access to data via XML or other methods to others for display in
mashups releases control and management of the data outside of the responsible
agency, which is a concern; the agency can no longer be sure that the data has
maintain its original nature.</p>

<p>If agencies are to proceed in adopting mashups within their organizations
and/or across the government and/or with third parties, best practices,
policies, and procedures will be needed to ensure the information and data's
authoritative nature is preserved when necessary. Government agencies, like any
organization, need to look to W3C or other standards organization for best
practices, lessons learned, and strategies.</p>
