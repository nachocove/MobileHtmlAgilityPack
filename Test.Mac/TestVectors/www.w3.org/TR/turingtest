<h2><a id="abstract" name="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>A common method of limiting access to services made available over the Web

  users who are blind, have low vision, or have a learning disability such as 
  dyslexia. This document examines a number of potential solutions that allow 
  systems to test for human users while preserving access by users with disabilities.</p>

<h2><a id="problem" name="problem">1. The problem</a></h2>
<p>Web sites with resources that are attractive to aggregators (travel and event 
  ticket sites, etc.) or other forms of automation (Web-based email, weblogs and 
  message boards) have taken measures to ensure that they can offer their service 
  to individual users without having their content harvested or otherwise exploited 
  by Web robots.</p>
<p>The most popular solution at present is the use of graphical representations 
  of text in registration or comment areas. The site attempts to verify that the 
  user in question is in fact a human by requiring the user to read a distorted 
  set of characters from a bitmapped image, then enter those characters into a 
  form.</p>
<p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have pioneered this method, which 
  they have called <acronym title="Completely Automated Public Turing 
  test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</acronym> (Completely Automated Public Turing 
  test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) [<a href="#ref-CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a>]. 
  Various groups are at work on projects based on or similar to this original, 
  and for the purpose of this paper, the term "CAPTCHA" is used to refer to all 
  of these projects collectively. A Turing test [<a href="#ref-TURING">TURING</a>], 
  named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing, is any system of tests designed 
  to differentiate a human from a computer.</p>
<p>This type of visual and textual verification comes at a huge price to users 
  who are blind, visually impaired or dyslexic. Naturally, this image has no text 
  equivalent accompanying it, as that would make it a giveaway to computerized 
  systems. In many cases, these systems make it impossible for users with certain 
  disabilities to create accounts, write comments, or make purchases on these 
  sites, that is, CAPTCHAs fail to properly recognize users with disabilities 
  as human.</p>
<h3><a id="security" name="security">1.1 A false sense of security</a></h3>
<p>It is important to note that, like seemingly every security system that has 
  preceded it, this system can be defeated by those who benefit most from doing 
  so. For example, spammers can pay a programmer to aggregate these images and 
  feed them one by one to a human operator, who could easily verify hundreds of 
  them each hour. The efficacy of visual verification systems is low, and their 
  usefulness is nullified once they are commonly exploited.</p>
<p>A history of how CAPTCHA has been adopted over the years is instructive. Larger 
  sites adopted CAPTCHA because their resources were easy to abuse for the purposes 
  of sending spam or conducting anonymous, illegal activity.</p>
<p>In recent times, however, inaccessible-by-design technologies such as CAPTCHA 
  have spread to smaller sites, and to new applications which further confound 
  assistive technology. Banking site ING Direct's "PIN Guard" [<a
    href="#ref-PINGUARD">PINGUARD</a>] uses a visual keypad to associate letters 
  on the keyboard with numbers in a user's passcode. Users who cannot see the 
  code, or understand the juxtaposition of letters and numbers, are unable to 
  access their own financial data on this site.</p>
<p>CAPTCHA is now in frequent use in the comment areas of message boards and personal 
  weblogs. Many bloggers claim that CAPTCHA challenges are successful in eradicating 
  comment spam, but below a certain threshold of popularity, any other method 
  of comment spam control should be reasonably successful -- and more accessible 
  to users with disabilities.</p>
<p>A number of data points on this false sense of security have arisen since this 
  document was first published. Part of the CAPTCHA Project at Carnegie Mellon 
  University, where the technique was developed, was a group intended to defeat 
  new CAPTCHAs as they were created. One of the first documented attacks on the 
  system was by a Carnegie Mellon student, who associated CAPTCHA images with 
  access to an adult Web site, thus gaining free human labor to crack the authentication. 
  High-value Web resources are always at risk for social-engineering attacks of 
  this nature, as humans can be hired, sometimes at near-slave wages, to defeat 
  hundreds if not thousands of these tests per hour.</p>
<p>External projects such as [<a href="#ref-BREAKING">BREAKING</a>], <a
    href="#ref-AICAPTCHA">[AICAPTCHA</a>] and [<a href="#ref-PWNTCHA">PWNTCHA</a>] 
  have shown methodologies and results indicating that many of the systems can 
  be defeated by computers with between 88% and 100% accuracy, using optical character 
  recognition. [<a href="#ref-BREAKINGOCR">BREAKINGOCR</a>] outlines a CAPTCHA 
  defeat on PHP- and ASP-based systems, in which known-valid session IDs are cached 
  and reused to circumvent several popular CAPTCHA schemes.&nbsp; The "Screen 
  Scraper" attack reported by the Anti-Phishing Working Group [<a
    href="#ref-ANTIPHISHING">ANTIPHISHING</a>] defeats the [<a
    href="#ref-PINGUARD">PINGUARD</a>] technique by capturing the screen when 
  the user clicks to enter their secret code.<br />
</p>
<p>It is a logical fallacy, then, to hail CAPTCHA as a spam-busting panacea. Even 
  10% accuracy by a computer amounts to system failure, just at a slower rate. 
  It is also faulty logic to believe that the adoption of CAPTCHA in large sites 
  is evidence of its supremacy in fighting spam. Indeed, a number of techniques 
  are as effective as CAPTCHA, without causing the human interaction step that 
  causes usability and accessibility issues.</p>
<h2><a id="hierarchy" name="hierarchy">2. A hierarchy of needs</a></h2>
<p>Sites implementing verification have very different needs, and they fall into 
  a hierarchy. As the bar for authentication is raised, so is the risk that many 
  users may be marginalized, and the damage that may cause.</p>
<h3><a id="privilege" name="privilege">2.1 Privilege</a></h3>
<p>Most systems implement security in some form or another to preserve privileges 
  for certain users. Authentication of a privileged user without a personal identification 
  scheme that cannot be repudiated is the current mechanism for all but the most 
  secure sites on the Web. We can open accounts on any number of email services, 
  portals, newspapers, and message boards without providing any credentials of 
  our own, such as a passport, driver's license or serial number. In these situations, 
  the first priority may be to point users to the resources they may access; security 
  itself may not take precedence until exploitable details such as credit card 
  information is stored on a given site.</p>
<h3><a id="humanity" name="humanity">2.2 Humanity</a></h3>
<p>Systems that offer attractive privileges are often exploited, particularly 
  when users can do so anonymously. The ability to create several accounts to 
  multiply a user's privileges is often the cause for these Turing tests to be 
  put into place. It is understood to be fact that human users interacting with 
  sites cannot consume resources as quickly as programs designed to acquire and 
  use free privileges. These sites wish to provide credentials to humans while 
  eliminating robot access to the same resources.</p>
<h3><a id="identity" name="identity">2.3 Identity</a></h3>
<p>Beyond humanity is unique human identity. A person's identity (including such 
  details as nationality, property, or even personal features) needs to be established 
  authoritatively in order to guarantee everything from secure and legal financial 
  transactions, to the security of medical and legal information, to fair elections. 
  All of these are becoming increasingly available online, including Web-based 
  voting, which has undergone trials in Sweden, Switzerland, France, the United 
  Kingdom, Estonia, and the United States.</p>
<p>It is important to determine solutions for verifying unique identity in users, 
  while balancing the needs of all potential users of such a system. The cost 
  of failure ranges from inconvenience in privilege-based models to the denial 
  of basic human rights in some identity-based systems.</p>
<h2><a id="solutions" name="solutions">3. Possible solutions</a></h2>
<p>There are many techniques available to users to discourage or eliminate fraudulent 
  account creations or uses. Several of them may be as effective as the visual 
  verification technique while being more accessible to people with disabilities. 
  Others may be overlaid as an accommodation for the purposes of accessibility. 
  Seven alternatives are listed below, with their individual pros and cons. Many 
  are achievable today, while some hint at a near future that may render this 
  need obsolete.</p>
<h3><a id="logic" name="logic">3.1 Logic puzzles</a></h3>
<p>The goal of visual verification is to separate human from machine. One reasonable 
  way to do this is to test for logic. Simple mathematical word puzzles, trivia, 
  and the like may raise the bar for robots, at least to the point where using 
  them is more attractive elsewhere.</p>
<p>Problems: Users with cognitive disabilities may still have trouble. Answers 
  may need to be handled flexibly, if they require free-form text. A system would 
  have to maintain a vast number of questions, or shift them around programmatically, 
  in order to keep spiders from capturing them all. This approach is also subject 
  to defeat by human operators.</p>
<h3><a id="sound" name="sound">3.2 Sound output</a></h3>
<p>To reframe the problem, text is easy to manipulate, which is good for assistive 
  technologies, but just as good for robots. So, a logical means of trying to 
  solve this problem is to offer another non-textual method of using the same 
  content. Hotmail serves a sound file that can be listened to if the visual verification 
  is not suitable for the user.</p>
<p>However, according to a CNet article [<a href="#ref-NEWSCOM">NEWSCOM</a>], 
  Hotmail's sound output, which is itself distorted to avoid the same programmatic 
  abuse, was unintelligible to all four test subjects, all of whom had "good hearing". 
  Users who are deaf-blind, don't have or use a sound card, work in noisy environments, 
  or don't have required sound plugins are likewise left in the lurch. Since this 
  content is auditory in nature, users often have to write down the code before 
  entering it, which is very inconvenient. Worst of all, some implementations 
  of this technique are JavaScript-based, or designed in such a way that some 
  blind users may not be able to access them. Machines, on the other hand, may 
  even have greater success with voice recognition software than they do with 
  OCR on visual CAPTCHAs.</p>
<h3><a id="limiteduse" name="limiteduse">3.3 Limited-use accounts</a></h3>
<p>Users of free accounts very rarely need full and immediate access to a site's 
  resources. For example, users who are searching for concert tickets may need 
  to conduct only three searches a day, and new email users may only need to send 
  a canned notification of their new address to their friends, and a few other 
  free-form messages. Sites may create policies that limit the frequency of interaction 
  explicitly (that is, by disabling an account for the rest of the day) or implicitly 
  (by slowing the response times incrementally). Creating limits for new users 
  can be an effective means of making high-value sites unattractive targets to 
  robots.</p>
<p>The drawbacks to this approach include having to take a trial-and-error approach 
  to determine a useful technique. It requires site designers to look at statistics 
  of normal and exceptional users, and determine whether a bright line exists 
  between them.</p>
<h3><a id="noninteractive" name="noninteractive">3.4 Non-interactive checks</a></h3>
<p>While CAPTCHA and other interactive approaches to spam control are sometimes 
  effective, they do make using a site more complex. This is often unnecessary, 
  as a large number of non-interactive mechanisms exist to check for spam or other 
  invalid content.</p>
<p>This category contains two popular non-interactive approaches: spam filtering, 
  in which an automated tool evaluates the <em>content</em> of a transaction, 
  and heuristic checks, which evaluate the <em>behavior</em> of the client.</p>
<h4><a id="bayesian" name="bayesian">3.4.1 Spam filtering</a></h4>
<p>Applications that use "hot words" to flag spam content, or Bayesian filtering 
  to detect other patterns consistent with spam, are very popular, and quite effective. 
  While such systems may experience false negatives from time to time, properly-tuned 
  systems are as effective as a CAPTCHA approach, while also removing the added 
  cognitive burden on the user.</p>
<p>Most major blogging software contains spam filtering capabilities, or can be 
  fitted with a plug-in for this functionality. Many of these filters can automatically 
  delete messages that reach a certain spam threshold, and mark questionable messages 
  for manual moderation. More advanced systems can control attacks based on post 
  frequency, filter content sent using the [<a href="#ref-TRACKBACK">TRACKBACK</a>] 
  protocol, and ban users by IP address range, temporarily or permanently.</p>
<h4><a id="heuristic" name="heuristic">3.4.2 Heuristic checks</a></h4>
<p>Heuristics are discoveries in a process that seem to indicate a given result. 
  It may be possible to detect the presence of a robotic user based on the volume 
  of data the user requests, series of common pages visited, IP addresses, data 
  entry methods, or other signature data that can be collected.</p>
<p>Again, this requires a good look at the data of a site. If pattern-matching 
  algorithms can't find good heuristics, then this is not a good solution. Also, 
  polymorphism, or the creation of changing footprints, is apt to result, if it 
  hasn't already, in robots, just as polymorphic ("stealth") viruses appeared 
  to get around virus checkers looking for known viral footprints.</p>
<p>Another heuristic approach identified in [<a href="#ref-KILLBOTS">KILLBOTS</a>] 
  involves the use of CAPTCHA images, with a twist: how the user reacts to the 
  test is as important as whether or not it was solved. This system, which was 
  designed to thwart distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, bans automated 
  attackers which make repeated attempts to retrieve a certain page, while protecting 
  against marking humans incorrectly as automated traffic. When the server's load 
  drops below a certain level, the authentication process is removed entirely.</p>
<h3><a id="federatedidentity" name="federatedidentity">3.5 Federated identity systems</a></h3>
<p>Competing efforts by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance are attempting to establish 
  a "federated network identity" system, which can allow a user to create an account, 
  set his or her preferences, payment data, etc., and have that data persist across 
  all sites that use the same service. This sort of system, which is making inroads 
  in both Web sites and Web Services, would allow a portable form of identification 
  across the Web.</p>
<h4><a id="singlesignon" name="singlesignon">3.5.1 Single sign-on</a></h4>
<p>Ironically enough, the Passport system itself is one of the very same services 
  that currently utilizes visual verification techniques. These single sign-on 
  services will have to be among the most accessible on the Web in order to offer 
  these benefits to people with disabilities. Additionally, use of these services 
  will need to be ubiquitous to truly solve the problems addressed here once and 
  for all.</p>
<h4><a id="pki" name="pki">3.5.2 Public-key infrastructure solutions</a></h4>
<p>Another approach is to use certificates for individuals who wish to verify 
  their identity. The certificate can be issued in such a way as to ensure something 
  close to a one-person-one-vote system by for example issuing these identifiers 
  in person and enabling users to develop distributed trust networks, or having 
  the certificates issued by highly trusted authorities such as governments. These 
  type of systems have been implemented for securing web pages, and for authenticating 
  email.</p>
<p>The cost of creating fraudulent certificates needs to be high enough to destroy 
  the value of producing them in most cases. Sites would need to use mechanisms 
  which are widely implemented in user agents.</p>
<p>A subset of this concept, in which only people with disabilities who are affected 
  by other verification systems would register, raises a privacy concern in that 
  the user would need to telegraph to every site that she has a disability. The 
  stigma of users with disabilities having to register themselves to receive the 
  same services should be avoided. With that said, there are a few instances in 
  which users may <em>want</em> to inform sites of their disabilities or other 
  needs: sites such as Bookshare [<a href="#ref-BOOKSHARE">BOOKSHARE</a>] require 
  evidence of a visual disability in order to allow users to access printed materials 
  which are often unavailable in audio or Braille form. An American copyright 
  provision known as the Chafee Amendment [<a href="#ref-CHAFEE">CHAFEE</a>] allows 
  copyrighted materials to be reproduced in forms that are only usable by blind 
  and visually impaired users. A public-key infrastructure system would allow 
  Bookshare's maintainers to ensure that the site and its users are in compliance 
  with copyright law.</p>
<h4><a id="biometrics" name="biometrics">3.5.3 Biometrics</a></h4>
<p>On the horizon, a more foolproof method of user verification is being formulated 
  in the field of biometric technology. A host of tests, from fingerprint and 
  retinal scanning to DNA matching, promise to check a person's identity authoritatively, 
  effectively limiting the ability of spammers to create infinite email accounts. 
  Microsoft has announced a new biometric system in its Longhorn operating system, 
  complete with a new, secure connector to capture this data. Biometrics will 
  very likely be used in conjunction with single sign-on services.</p>
<p>Again, the weakness here is based on infrastructure. It will take several years 
  for biometric hardware to penetrate a market, and some political and social 
  issues exist which may hold back the process. Biometric systems will also have 
  to take into account the fact that not all people have the same physical features: 
  for example, retinal scanning does not work for a user who was born without 
  eyes.</p>
<h3><a id="other" name="other">3.6 Other approaches</a></h3>
<p>One approach that remains somewhat popular where identity is concerned is the 
  use of existing artifacts of identity, such as credit cards and national IDs 
  such as the Social Security number in the United States. While these systems 
  do provide an easy way to verify users against systems at low cost, their value 
  has been discounted in this paper due to their insecurity. Moreover, systems 
  which collect this data from large numbers of users create a more attractive 
  target for identity theft than they ever did for misappropriation of services.</p>
<p>Recently, Google has sent its account creation keys to new users via a Short 
  Message Service (SMS) message. While introducing new complications such as somewhat 
  limited worldwide penetration for mobile phones, thereby creating a different 
  sort of barrier, and poor accessibility to SMS features among users who are 
  blind, it does limit the extent to which large systems can be exploited. It's 
  not feasible, for example, for someone to use thousands of phones to farm account 
  keys daily, then exchange them for new phones when the service refuses to send 
  more keys. Sadly, the Google account creation system still requires a CAPTCHA 
  in addition to this security measure. This technique is included to encourage 
  innovative thought around using architectural constraints, with real costs involved, 
  to impact the feasibility of exploiting a Web resource.</p>
<h2><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion">4. Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Sites with attractive resources and millions of users will always have a need 
  for access control systems that limit widespread abuse. At that level, it is 
  reasonable to employ many concurrent approaches, including audio and visual 
  CAPTCHA, to do so. However, it must be noted that human users will fall through 
  the cracks in these systems, and it will be necessary for sites like these to 
  ensure that users with disabilities will have some human-operated means of interacting 
  with a given resource in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>The widespread use of CAPTCHA in low-volume, low-resource sites, on the other 
  hand, is unnecessarily damaging to the experience of users with disabilities. 
  An explicitly inaccessible access control mechanism should not be promoted as 
  a solution, especially when other systems exist that are not only more accessible, 
  but may be more effective, as well. It is strongly recommended that smaller 
  sites adopt spam filtering and/or heuristic checks in place of CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>Lastly, new approaches focusing on using exclusively visual or auditory means 
  for access control, such as the "PIN Guard" mentioned above, should be scrapped 
  until a reliable method exists for users who cannot access them to authenticate 
  themselves. A short-term security benefit is not worth threatening a person's 
  autonomy by denying them access to such important data as their finances.</p>
