<h1><a name="Introducti">I. Introduction to P3P</a></h1>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="What is P3"></a>I.1. What is the Platform for Privacy Preferences
(P3P) Project?</h3>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Privacy/">Platform for Privacy Preference
Project </a>is an activity of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">The World Wide
Web Consortium.</a> For brevity, we often refer to the Platform for Privacy
Preferences project, activity, products, or specifications as "P3P."<a
href="#*">*</a>  The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) enables
Web sites to express their privacy practices in a standard format that can be
retrieved automatically and interpreted easily by user agents. P3P user agents
will allow users to be informed of site practices (in both machine- and
human-readable formats) and to automate decision-making based on these
practices when appropriate. Thus users need not read the privacy policies at
every site they visit.</p>

<p>Although P3P provides a technical mechanism for ensuring that users can be
informed about privacy policies before they release personal information, it
does not provide a technical mechanism for making sure sites act according to
their policies. Products implementing this specification MAY provide some
assistance in that regard, but that is up to specific implementations and
outside the scope of this specification. However, P3P is complementary to laws
and self-regulatory programs that can provide enforcement mechanisms. In
addition, P3P does not include mechanisms for transferring data or for
securing personal data in transit or storage. P3P may be built into tools
designed to facilitate data transfer. These tools should include appropriate
security safeguards.</p>

<p>The aim of P3P is to increase user trust and confidence in the Web. The
ideas behind the design of this technology were written down in an annex to
the Specification called "<a href="../TR/P3P#guiding_principles">Guiding
Principles</a>".</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="What is the Status of P3"></a>I.2. What is the Status of P3P
1.0</h3>

<h4>First Phase (Ended October '97)</h4>
At the completion of the first phase of working groups in October '97, the W3C
publicly released the the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P-arch.html">Architectural Overview</a> and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P-grammar.html">Grammatical Model</a>
Drafts. The Architecture Working Group synthesized W3C work (the <a
href="#RDF">RDF</a> "meta-data" work stemming from our <a
href="http://www.w3.org/PICS">PICS</a> activity), the <a href="#OPS">Open
Profiling Standard (OPS)</a>, the <a href="#MS Profiling">Profiling and
Privacy</a> submission, and work from other W3C members to create a general
architecture for privacy notice. The Vocabulary/Grammar Working Group focussed
on how one makes meaningful statements about privacy in a way that is
understandable by humans and computers.

<h4>Second Phase (Ended March '98)</h4>
The second phase consisted of two working groups. The Protocols and Data
Transport group specified the communication primitives necessary for sending
P3P requests and practices across the Web. The protocol works over HTTP1.0+.

<p>The Harmonized Vocabulary Working Group specified a vocabulary used for
describing Web privacy practices. It was designed to be reflective of a
diversity of privacy laws, self-regulatory norms, and cultural notions about
privacy. This vocabulary can be used to express policies as diverse as
anonymous browsing to the provision of personalized Web content and
services.</p>

<p>The <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-P3P-harmonization">P3P
Harmonized Vocabulary Specification Public Working Draft</a></b> was made
available on 30 March 98. The Protocol and Data Transport White Paper will be
publicly released in May '98, concurrent with the publication of the P3P1.0
Working Draft (from the Syntax and Encoding Working Group) since much of the
protocol has been simplified by the latter group.</p>

<h4>Third Phase (Last-Call, ends 30-April 2000)</h4>

<p>After the patent-issue, the P3P-Activity had to cross some troubled water.
P3P has a special position within the work of W3C, as it had some unattended
problems and treats a particularly complex area.(see the related question I.6)
Finding a solution was hardened by the complex transatlantic struggle over
privacy values.  On 11-November 1999, the group issued his Last-Call Draft. In
the W3C-Process, this means, that the group is checking dependencies with
other W3C-technologies and looks for feedback from the public. Taking the
extraordinary situation of P3P into account, W3C decided to extend the period
of Last-Call from normally 6 weeks to 6 months to permit a maximum feedback
from all stakeholders. After the release of the first public Last-Call-Draft,
the Specification-Group had strong feedback from the public. In October 1999,
the Policy-Outreach-Working-Group was added to the Activity to treat with the
multiple policy implications and to help in the deployment of P3P. Due to the
strong feedback, the Working-Draft has known major changes. The <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P">latest Draft</a> is from 4-April 2000 and the
next Draft is expected around 24-April 2000.</p>

<h4>Fourth Phase (Candidate Recommendation, May to Automn)</h4>

<p>After checking dependencies and input from the public during the last-call
period and having cleared all remaining issues, the P3P-Specification will be
moved to Candidate Recommandation. In this state, W3C is solliciting
implementations of this Specification. There will be workshops, where
implementers can test the interoperability of their products and prototypes.
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/interop.html">first interop-workshop</a>
will be on 21-June 2000 in Manhattan. A second interop-workshop will take
place in Venice at the end of September during the world meeting of data
commissioners. A third interop in Asia is not excluded.</p>

<h3><a name="future"></a>I.3 Is P3P 1.0 the end of W3C's work on
privacy?</h3>

<p>There is interest in future versions of P3P. Much of the current Activities
within W3C have to address privacy. There are other initiatives within W3C,
like CC/PP, the protocol to address the Device dependent services for mobile
phones and PDA's or W3C's work on Position-dependent services, which will need
negotiation and other features in the future to be able to address privacy.
There are also a <a href="../TR/P3P#Implementing">lot of features left out in
P3P 1.0</a> for faster implementation, that could be addressed in a renewed
Activity. When the work on XML Signature is finished, this will also enable
P3P, as it is written in XML, to address the issue of authentication of a
policy-issuer. This work would have to be chartered and instantiated according
to W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">process</a>.</p>

<h3 id="I.4."><a name="negotiation"></a>I.4. What happened to the negotiation
and data-transfer protocol?</h3>

<p>The negotiation was removed from the P3P 1.0 Specification. The
P3P-Specification Working-Group felt, that the protocol for negotiation and
data-transfer is far to complex to implement and would hinder a first rapid
and widespread implementation and deployment of P3P-Technology. At the time of
the decision, there was not that much interest from the industry to implement
the data-transfer mechanism. The favor was given to electronic wallets and
there was no initiative to standardize this kind of application. Also, there
was a lot of critique in the US about the data-transfer-protocol and
negotiation while in Europe, the Data Commissioners still want to see
negotiation in P3P. The Specification-Group therefor decided to postpone the
further work on negotiation and data-transfer to a future version of P3P. See
the also the page from Daniel La Liberte on the removal of <a
href="data-transfer.html">data-transfer</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="patent"></a><a name="I.5.">I.5. What is the status of the
patent-claims on P3P?</a></h3>

<p>The P3P Activity had more to bear than just the policy implications, which
was rather new to a body like W3C. It had also to face the problem, that
participants of early Working-Groups were working on a patent on the same
technology. When Intermind Inc. announced it's patent claims on
P3P-Technology, the Activity stalled for a moment. W3C has spend ressources
and ordered an <a href="../TR/P3P-analysis">expertise on the patent claims</a>
from a major patent-law firm. In his outline on the result, Barry Rein
explained, why implementing P3P does not infringe the patent of Intermind Inc.
As P3P 1.0 contains neither negotiation nor data-transfer, there is nearly no
risk of Infringement of US Patent 5,862,325.</p>

<h3 id="taken">I.6 Why has P3P taken so long to reach candidate
recommendation?</h3>

<p>The P3P-Activity suffered from multiple struggles, that reinforced each
other.</p>

<p>Let's begin with technology. When P3P began, there was also the beginning
of RDF. PICS as a format was not rich enough to express the complex statements
about privacy that were needed. But with PICS W3C had a first experience with
a so called "social protocol". RDF offered the opportunity to allow a much
richer  vocabulary. But RDF had not yet Schemas, so the data-format of P3P was
invented from scratch in an own format. At the moment, when everybody was
feeling, that P3P will be in it's final stage, the patent claim of Intermind
was a shock for the Working-Groups around P3P and for W3C too. Many active
participants stopped their work on P3P, because they considered it too risky
to continue the project and face claims for royalties or denial of license
afterwards. The Activity around P3P stalled for a while. But not all Members
stepped out of the project. IBM, AT&amp;T, NEC, CDT, Truste, Microsoft and
American Express continued to support P3P. As W3C is a relativly young
standards body, it was the first time, that it had to face this kind of issue.
It took some time to determine, how to handle this issue. In the meantime, XML
was invented and became a hype. Due to the patent-issue, the WG was not fast
enough to finish before the XML-hype. So P3P had also to accomodate this new
format and reinvent a lot of things, that were already done. (The future will
show whether this was good or bad for P3P)</p>

<p>Additionally, the W3C-staff responsible for the activity kept on changing.
After Joseph Reagle had left P3P to work on XML Signature, Rolf Nelson worked
on P3P. As he left W3C, Daniel La Liberte took over. With the help of Lorrie
Cranor as a very active chair, remaining active members and participants, and
the strong support from Danny Weitzner, the T-and-S Domain Lead, La Liberte
was able to steer the Activity back to a new vitality. He left W3C at the
beginning of 2000 to join Crystalize, a W3C-Member, and continues to be part
of the P3P-Specification-Group. New Team-Member Rigo Wenning took over and
continued his work with two very active Working-Groups.</p>

<p>As one can see in the policy-section of this FAQ, P3P was in the middle of
several political struggles over privacy. First, there was a strong influence
of the US-battle over the question, whether privacy should be regulated by law
or industry-driven self-regulation. By some stakeholders, P3P was presented as
the technology, that solves this conflict of interests. Despite several
expressions of the P3P-Developpers, that P3P is only a complementary tool,
this was held as a strong critique against P3P. At the same time, P3P was also
hit by the conflict between the EU and the US over transatlantic flow of
personal data. The EU Directive on the protection of personal data required
adequate protection to let the data flow. "Safe Harbour" is one of the
buzzwords in this ongoing struggle. In the changing political environment, the
needs expressed to P3P-Developpers changed also.</p>

<h3><a name="changed?">I.7 How has P3P changed and why did it change in this
way?</a></h3>

<p>It is very difficult to answer this question shortly. At the beginning, P3P
was more oriented towards e-commerce. Over time and with a lot of feedback
from outside, P3P changed and was enhanced by contributions from all over the
world. From the beginning on, the P3P-Developpers came from three continents:
America, Europe and Asia. The aim was to provide a platform, which would be
able to express values of very different legal and social environments. The
first very ambitious approach to provide a privacy-tool with negotiation and
automated data-transfer was too complicated for a rapid deployment. It was
removed. The language for policies was rewritten in XML to provide a simpler
interface for people writing policies and to follow the main stream in
e-commerce. Also, at the beginning the idea of better service to users seemed
to be of a major concern. Following the feedback from Privacy Activists and
from the European Commission, there was a shift towards a more balanced
vocabulary. In October 1999, the Policy Outreach Group started and gave a lot
of feedback on the vocabulary. New features, like the physical address of the
service, remedies and retention and other useful features were added. The
active debate of Data Commissioners and Privacy Activists with people from
Industry gave us a good result and provided a viable solution. The Developers
had also a careful eye, that P3P, especially the data schema, could also be of
use for business-to-business applications.</p>

<h3><a name="Implemented_P3P"></a>I.8 Who has implemented P3P?</h3>

<p>After the end of the Last-Call period, the specification is stable, but not
yet recommended. When the P3P-Specification goes to Candidate Recommendation,
W3C is encouraging implementations. There are already some
test-implementations based on older Working-Drafts and ongoing work on
implementing P3P: See  <a href="implementations.html">Implementation
References</a> for a list of known implementations and services related to
P3P..</p>

<p>We encourage every interested implementer to contact the P3P-Team to
participate in one of the planned interop's. The first interop will be held on
21-June 2000 in New York. There will be a second interop in Venice in
September. We expect implementations from the US, Europe and Japan. We do not
believe an incomplete implementation of P3P will satisfy the privacy
requirements of the Web community.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="III.">II. Technology</h2>
There are a number of efforts, proposals, and organizations addressing Web
privacy. We do not believe technology alone can address the many issues
associated with privacy online. This section briefly explains the differences
between these efforts from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C's</a> point of
view as well as some frequently asked questions about features in P3P.

<p>A model to have in mind when examining P3P is that it leverages much
existing work, and that many products and services can be built upon the
Platform for Privacy Preferences. P3P is based on <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Overview.html">RDF</a>/<a
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>.. Other products and services can then
be built upon P3P. For instance, on top of the Platform, others can offer
assurance, auditing services, arbitration or mediation to ensure such privacy
statements are valid or provide help in different models of privacy
protection.</p>

<h3>II.1 <a name="RDF"></a>RDF and XML</h3>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Overview.html">RDF</a>/<a
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> are the meta-data and encoding
specifications that we will use for exchanging information in P3P. Our <a
href="www.w3.org/PICS">PICS</a> effort allowed one to make simple statements
about Web resources. RDF will give us a more generalized and sophisticated
framework for discussing privacy practices and preferences. In the Cambridge
Communiqué, the RDF and the XML Community agreed, that documents should be
expressed in XML, while meta-data and statements about documents should be
expressed in RDF. RDF itself is based on XML, a means of structuring data. The
policies are written in XML, but they can easily be transformed into RDF. An
annex of the Specification provide's a model for expressing the P3P-model also
in RDF.

<h2 id="III.2.">II.2. What is <a href="../TR/P3P-preferences">APPEL</a> and
what is it's relationship to P3P?</h2>

<p><a href="../TR/P3P-preferences">APPEL</a> specifies a language for
describing collections of preferences regarding P3P proposals between P3P
agents. Using this language, a user can express her preferences in a set of
preference-rules (called <b>ruleset</b>), which can then be used by her
user-agent to make automated or semi-automated decisions regarding the
exchange of data with P3P enabled Web sites.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This language is intended as a transmission format; individual
implementations must be able to read and write their specifications in this
language, but need not use this format internally.</p>

<p><strong>Goals of A P3P Preference Exchange Language</strong></p>

<p>The P3P1.0 specification provides a syntax for specifying proposals and a
protocol and associated syntax for exchanging information between the Web site
and user agent. It does not not specify requirements upon the graphical user
interface (GUI) or trust engines. However, there are benefits to being able to
express the preferences as captured by the GUI and processed by the trust
engine:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Sharing and installation of rulesets.</b> Sophisticated preferences
    may be difficult for end-users to specify, even through well-crafted user
    interfaces. An organization can create a set of recommended preferences
    for users. Users who trust that organization can install a pre-defined
    ruleset rather than specifying a new set from scratch. It will be easy to
    change the active ruleset on a single computer, or to carry a ruleset to a
    new computer.</li>
  <li><b>Communication to agents, search engines, proxies, or other
    servers.</b> Servers of various kinds may wish to tailor their output to
    better meet users' preferences, as expressed in a ruleset.  For example, a
    search service can return only links that match a user's ruleset, which
    may specify criteria based on a variety of factors including quality,
    privacy, age suitability, or the safety of downloadable code.</li>
  <li><b>Portability between products.</b> The same ruleset will work with any
    P3P-APPEL enabled product.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document provides a proposal for options to be considered in the
development of a privacy and profiling specification. This document delineates
a number of architectural options for the P3P project.</p>

<h3>II.5 Is W3C working on OPS?</h3>

<p>No. W3C is working on P3P. At the start, a part of it was influenced by the
OPS submission.</p>

<h3><a name="Who is involved in working on P3?"></a>II.6 Who was/is working on
P3P?</h3>

<p>As of the date of this document, the following members have been publicly
involved with P3P efforts: American Express, America Online, Art Technology
Group, AT&amp;T Labs, Center for Democracy and Technology, Citigroup, Digital
Equipment Corporation, DISA, DoubleClick, Engage Technologies, Ernst &amp;
Young LLP, Firefly Network Inc, IBM, Intermind Corporation, MatchLogic,
Microsoft, MIT, Narrowline, NEC, Netscape Communications, Open Market Inc.,
Open Sesame, Oracle Corporation, Sony, The DMA, TRUSTe, VeriSign and GMD.</p>

<p>Other parties beyond W3C members (invited experts) have been involved in
the work of P3P. These participants can be found in the <b>Contributor</b>
section of P3P working group deliverables. It is worth noting the efforts
given to the P3P-project by the Office of the Information <a
href="http://www.ipc.on.ca/">Privacy Commissioner of Ontario</a> and the <a
href="http://www.rewi.hu-berlin.de/Datenschutz/DSB/SH/">Schleswig-Holstein
Data Commissioner.</a> who are invited experts.</p>

<p>The Working Group would also like to thank the many contributors, which
gave feedback on the <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-p3p-public-comments/">P3P public
mailing-list</a>.</p>

<h3>II.7 <a name="What is the difference between P3 and OPS?"></a>What is the
difference between P3P and OPS?</h3>

<p>While P3P and OPS are somewhat similar, the focus and originating
requirement of each technology is different. P3P was initially focussed on
enabling the expression of privacy practices and preferences. OPS's focus was
on the secure storage, transport, and control of user data. It has been clear
to the developers of P3P from the beginning that "data exchange" is relevant
to P3P. (If a site asks you for a piece of information, they might as well
tell you what their practice is.) When OPS was submitted to P3P, P3P members
decided to examine OPS and determine how to integrate P3P with data exchange.
To put it simply, P3P originally allowed a service and user to reach an
explicit understanding about the site's data privacy practices. OPS allows
users to control the release of their data in a secure manner. Today, all the
data-transfer protocol is removed from P3P, see also <a
href="#negotiation">question I.4</a></p>

<h3>II.8 <a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h3>
HTTP is a stateless protocol. Servers do not know if requests for any two
pages or objects embedded within them (like GIFs) were generated from the same
person. Many Web sites wish to have a "session" with a user, meaning that
state is retained for each user browsing a site. <a
href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">Cookies</a> usually do not contain very
much data; they typically act like a 'customer number'. For instance, if I
place an orange in my shopping basket on one page, when I go to the next page,
the site would see I am the same user who placed the orange in my shopping
basket previously. This is known as "session state." Cookies have also been
used to create "persistent state." Meaning if I return to that site 3 days
later, they can know I am the same user who visited 3 days ago and purchased
an orange. Information in cookies are generally available only to the creator
of the cookie. The relevance of that data is useful to those who can look up
the information associated with the "customer number."

<p>Cookies have been contentious of late because of the way in which users are
prompted to accept cookies, particularly cookies which come from "external"
sites. (One site can embed a cookie from another site in its own page.)</p>

<p>The W3C is not working on cookies. However, P3P does include a mechanism
that will support some of the functionality sites derive from cookies. This
functionality is then under explicit P3P control and has privacy disclosures
associated with it. Additionally, the P3P contains a "Safe Zone", which
doesn't allow P3P-compliant servers to set a cookie before the client has
fetched the privacy-policy. User-agents could block cookies in the "Safe
Zone". See also the question about the "Safe Zone".</p>

<p>A number of efforts are underway at the <a
href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF</a> to give cookies a greater privacy
framework. Including a <a href="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc2109.txt">new
version</a> of the cookie protocol, and a proposal for <a
href="http://www.w3.org/PICS/extensions/cookieinfo-1_0.html">labeling cookies
with privacy disclosures</a>.</p>

<h3 id="II.9">II.9 Can P3P address embedded content?</h3>

<p>Embedded content are all the images and things, that are loaded together
with a document (e.g. an HTML-page). Normally, the embedded content comes from
the same server, as the main document. This content can easily be addressed by
the so called "realm", to which a certain policy applies. Things get much more
complicated, when an author embedd's content from a site, where he has no
control over the privacy policy. A perfect example to this issue are
banner-ads, which come from a different server than the one serving the
HTML-page. The policy-reference file would allow also to make a statement
about this embedded content, if there is control of the author of a page over
the privacy policy, which applies to the embedded content. In absence of
control over the embedded content, the user agent will first verify the
privacy-policy attached to this embedded content by a head request, before
requesting the content itself. For this (Head-) request, the "Safe Zone"
applies.</p>

<h3 id="II.10">II.10 Does P3P require new server software?</h3>

<p>P3P 1.0 uses the normal http 1.1 protocol for the exchange of policies. The
matching of the policies to the preferences takes place on the client. So P3P
could be installed on major Server implementations like Apache, Jigsaw,
Netscape-Server or Internet Informations Server from Microsoft. The
Specification Working Group has developed some guidelines for
configuration.</p>

<h3 id="II.11">II.11 How does P3P impact Web performance?</h3>

<p>In a distributed system like the World Wide Web, with high network
latencies and never enough bandwidth, caching is very important to give
acceptable performance to users. In this light, it is important to consider
the interaction of P3P with caches in the network. The P3P-Specification
contains a whole subtree on the subject of caching policies and references.
But already in the design of P3P, the group spent a lot of effort to improve
performance. With the policy-reference file, a server can define for a whole
site, which policy applies to which "realm" or page. The link to this file can
be given by a Head-request or by a LINK-tag within the header of a HTML-page.
The use of LINK-tag/Header in conjunction with a policy reference file reduces
the amount of transfered data and spares additional roundtrips.</p>

<h3 id="II.12">II.12 What are Categories?</h3>

<p>Categories are attributes of data elements that provide hints to users and
user agents as to the intended uses of the data. Categories are vital to
making P3P user agents easier to implement and use; they allow users to
express more generalized preferences and rules over the exchange of their
data. Categories are often included when defining a new element or when
referring to data that the user is prompted to type in (as opposed to data
stored in the user data repository). Categories themselves are not
data-elements, but are a more generalized description of a set of single
data-elements, which belong to this category. A single data-element like
user.name.personname can belong to multiple categories at the same time. See
the Chapter in the Specification for more information.</p>

<h3 id="II.13">II.13. Can P3P address different policies for the same server
or one policy for multiple servers?</h3>

<p>By it's policy-reference-file, by defining "realms" in the header of the
answer, servers can not only define different policies on the same server, but
also a same policy for different servers. To define different policies on the
same server can be useful, when there are pages, that can be browsed and where
the service doesn't collect any data and other pages for shopping or feedback,
where data is collected and a certain purpose would be addressed. One could
also imagine, that in parts of the server the purpose of data collection is
different from another part. All this can be addressed. If there is huge
service with different servers where only one policy applies, this can also be
addressed by the reference-mechanism provided by P3P 1.0. For more detail, see
the <a href="../TR/P3P#reference">reference-section</a> in the
P3P-Specification.</p>

<h3 id="II.14.">II.14. What's the scope of a P3P policy?</h3>

<p>As we have seen in <a href="#II.13">question II.13</a> P3P has very
flexible means to address the range of pages and servers which are addressed
by a policy. In addition, policies identify the data recipients, and make a
variety of other disclosures including information about dispute resolution,
and the address of a site's human-readable privacy policy. P3P policies must
cover all relevant data elements and practices (but note that legal issues
regarding law enforcement demands for information are not addressed by this
specification; it is possible that a site that otherwise abides by its policy
of not redistributing data to others may be required to do so by force of
law). P3P declarations are positive, meaning that sites state what they do,
rather than what they do not do.</p>

<h3 id="II.15">II.15. Does P3P specify a common policy for opt-out?</h3>

<p>The P3P specificatiion does not directly address opt-out. We do have a
change_preferences field in our public working draft. In general, many
companies offer individuals an opportunity to opt-out of certain types of uses
of their data. For example, a company may allow you to opt-out of having your
name included on their mailing list. Whether your name is actually erased
entirely from their database depends on the company. If you are a customer,
they will probably keep your name so that they have a record of whatever
transactions you have done with them. You may find additional information
about opt out on the Online Privacy Alliance web site at <a
href="http://www.privacyalliance.org/">http://www.privacyalliance.org/</a></p>

<h3 id="II.16.">II.16. Is P3P designed to allow anonymous surfing?</h3>

<p>There is already existing software, which is designed to minimize the data
your client transfers to a server. They also fake wrong information and pass
it to a server. Another approach is to have different pseudonyms for the
purpose of surfing. P3P addresses only a minor part by specifying a "Safe
Zone" in which a P3P-compliant server should only gather a minimum of
information about a client, e.g. the IP-Address to prevent malicious attacks,
and that also there shouldn't be a long retention of that IP-Address.</p>

<h2>III. P3P and <a name="Privacy"></a>Privacy</h2>

<h3>III.1 Does P3P <a name="solve"></a>solve all privacy concerns on the
Web?</h3>
No. P3P focuses on privacy practice disclosure with respect to data collected
through Web interactions.

<p></p>

<h3><a name="III.2">III.2 Is P3P doomed to fail, because it is not in the
interest of commerce?</a></h3>

<p>By reducing complexity of human readable privacy - policies into a
machine-readable format, P3P allows experts like self-regulation bodies and
data commissioners to transport their knowledge as a software or as policies
and preferences over the net. Ideally, the complexity for businesses to comply
and follow fair privacy practices will decrease too by the use of P3P.</p>

<p>By specifying a common format for data and vocabulary, a user agent could
trace, where a user has left data for what purpose, which increases the
possibility for data self-determination. At the same time, the common
extensible XML-based data-format will decrease transformation-costs for
business. By specifying a machine-readable privacy-language, privacy-values
and -preferences can be included into databases, thus enabeling business to
better respect user's preferences or law-requirements. In order to deploy
P3P-based technology, it is useful to create a model for a win/win situation
for users and business.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>III.3 Does P3P limit the need for other privacy technologies like <a
name="encryption"></a>encryption or Web anonymizers?</h3>
Definitely not. In fact, in order to "do one thing, and do it well" we focus
P3P on its mission of establishing privacy disclosure and defer to other
privacy technologies for communications and storage confidentiality. For
instance, users must be able to express preferences such that, "I will only
give my credit card information to sites over a secured communication channel
such as SSL or SET." We don't attempt to reinvent anonymizers, encryption or
payment protocols within P3P but it will be able to work with all of these
things.

<h3>III.4 How does P3P fit into various <a name="regulatory"></a>regulatory
frameworks?</h3>
Currently, there is a great deal of policy debate regarding the correct
regulatory framework for data protection and privacy. This debates occurs
along a number of lines: industry-self-regulation versus government
regulation, sectorial regulation versus omnibus regulation, and which policy
instruments are most effective (contractual obligations and liability,
auditing, trusted third parties and marks, criminal or civil penalties,
ombudsman, etc.). The W3C takes no position on the efficacy or desirability of
any specific policy. Instead, we work with the relevant constituencies to 1)
ensure that our technical design will support a wide range of options and 2)
explain the scope and capabilities of P3P.

<h3>III.5 What will the ultimate <a name="impact"></a>impact on users' privacy
and Web commerce be?</h3>
Two concerns regarding P3P are frequently expressed:
<ul>
  <li>users will sell or barter away their privacy to get access to a
  site.</li>
  <li>sites' traditional practices (such as collecting HTTP log activity -- <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/privacy-statement.html#Public">the
    W3C does it itself</a>) will be challenged/threatened.</li>
</ul>
P3P is predicated on the assumption that IF sites and users wish to exchange
information it should happen in the context of an explicit agreement. The
technology should not preclude a mutually satisfactory balance from being
achieved. Otherwise, this issue is an important policy debate for society at
large. P3P is designed such that it is the individuals, markets, and
regulatory frameworks that ultimately determine the balance -- as it should
be.

<p></p>

<h3 id="III.6">III.6 What is the scope of P3P. Is P3P replacing blocking
software like junkbuster<sup>[tm]</sup> or webwasher?</h3>

<p>P3P is definitly not a technology that replaces all current Privacy
Enhancing Technologies (PET's). But the scope and way of addressing privacy is
different from the currently known software, which tries to limit the amount
of data, or fake's data, that a server can retrieve. These blocking tools, as
they could be called, are only addressing the issue of hidden and unnotified
collection of data. P3P goes far beyond that. When doing e-commerce,
especially in the business-to-consumer area, sometimes a user must give his
data to receive a service or a good. One could also imagine cases, where the
user want's to give his data away for better service. But must this be the end
of privacy? Can this data then be used freely, because it is out? A blocking
tools doesn't help in this context. With P3P, it is possible to express the
further use of this data and naturally the limitations of that use. But
remember, P3P doesn't guarantee that the service behind the policy does what
it announced to do with your data. Blocking tools are still very useful to
prevent unnoticed collection of data. This could be combined in an P3P-enabled
user-agent.</p>
While the following questions is often cast from the perspective of Europe,
they could equally apply to any jurisdiction.

<h3>III.7 Can P3P be used in <a name="Europe"></a>Europe?</h3>
Presently, yes. However, merely using P3P does not excuse a service from the
legal obligations it may have. It could be used in any jurisdiction if it
<i>is used in a way </i>that complies with the laws of that jurisdiction. P3P
is a method of making consensual and informed decisions on the basis of
privacy practice disclosures. This may be sufficient in some cases; it may not
be in others. For instance, some jurisdictions may have specific data
collection, access, and retention prohibitions or requirements. Or they may
have additional enforcement and reporting requirements. The flexibility to
solicit information and make a wide range of disclosures does not
<i>necessarily</i> mean that all solicitations and privacy practices are
permissible. Rather, the flexibility enables P3P to be used in conjunction
with various laws and policies the world over.

<h3>III.8 Is P3P compliant with the Data <a
name="Directive"></a>Directive?</h3>
It is not exactly clear how the directive (or P3P) will be implemented.
Regardless, we are not in the position to make such an assessment. However,
P3P was carefully crafted to ensure that its design did not preclude it from
being used in Europe or elsewhere.

<p>Use of P3P on its own does not constitute compliance with the Data
Directive, however P3P can be an important part of directive compliance for
Web services.</p>

<h3>III.9 Is P3P an <a name="American"></a>American technology?</h3>
Many of the prominent member companies that worked on P3P are based in the US
but have international interests. The design of the data practices vocabulary
(the part most related to policy) was definitely an international effort.
Nearly half of the members of the Working Group that worked on the vocabulary
were invited privacy experts and privacy commissioner staff, many of which
were from Europe.

<h3>III.10 How can a user of P3P know if a sites practices are <a
name="legal"></a>legal?</h3>
Services have the ability to represent if their practices are bound by a legal
entity or other assurance party. This party <b>assures</b> that the stated
practices are valid. This could be the service itself, a third party auditor,
trust mark, or a regulatory body. Consequently, a service could refer to a
regulatory authority to represent its practices are in compliance with his
local jurisdiction's regulations.

<h3>III.11 How does P3P deal with users browsing Web sites <a
name="outside"></a>outside of their country?</h3>
Issues related to privacy protection across jurisdictions are complex; this is
why we designed P3P as we did. A compelling feature of P3P is that it is based
on privacy disclosures. Consequently, regardless of where a user goes, they
have the capability to make informed decisions. This also allows users to ask
for practices which match their own preferences or the governing law of their
own jurisdiction.
