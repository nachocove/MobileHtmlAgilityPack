<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 1.0</h1>

  <p><strong>Published December 2002</strong>

</p>
  <blockquote>
<p>[UAAG 1.0] provides guidelines for designing user agents that
lower barriers to Web accessibility for people with disabilities
(visual, hearing, physical, cognitive, and neurological). User
agents include HTML browsers and other types of software that
retrieve and render Web content. A user agent that conforms to
these guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user
interface and through other internal facilities, including its
ability to communicate with other technologies (especially
assistive technologies).<br clear="none" />

<div class="questions">
<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="target-audience" name="target-audience">Who should read UAAG 1.0?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 is primarily written for:</p>

<ul>
<li>software developers,</li>

<li>users with disabilities, and</li>

<li>people who purchase software and who wish to know which
software meets accessibility requirements.</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="quick-view" name="quick-view">Where can I find a quick introduction to UAAG
1.0?</a></h2>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/uaag10-summary.html">summary of
UAAG 1.0</a> introduces the document, and a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/uaag10-chktable">checklist</a>
summarizes the document's requirements.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="ua-def" name="ua-def">What
is a user agent?</a></h2>

<p>A user agent is any piece of software (or combination of pieces
of software) -- including browsers, multimedia players, graphics
viewers, plug-ins, and assistive technologies -- that helps
retrieve and render Web content for users.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="ua-access" name="ua-access">What is an accessible user agent?</a></h2>

<p>Informally, an "accessible user agent" is software that provides
access to Web content for users with disabilities. UAAG 1.0 defines
conformance for different types of software; software that conforms
to UAAG 1.0 provides more accessibility for Web users with
disabilities.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="who-benefits" name="who-benefits">Which users with disabilities benefit from UAAG
1.0?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 is designed to improve accessibility for users with
visual, hearing, physical, cognitive, and neurological
disabilities. For more information on Web accessibility, please
refer to the Web Accessibility Initiative's "<a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/">How People with
Disabilities Use the Web</a>."</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="other-benefits" name="other-benefits">Do accessibility features benefit users
without disabilities?</a></h2>

<p>Many of the accessibility features required by UAAG 1.0 also
improve usability for many other individuals. For instance,
keyboard operation of the user agent benefits some users with
visual and physical disabilities, but also benefits users who
prefer keyboard access (e.g., expert users). UAAG 1.0 requirements
are expected to benefit users with slow Internet connections, as
well as users who use their computer in a situation where their
hands, ears, or eyes may be busy with other activities.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="content-reqs" name="content-reqs">Do accessible user agents mean that authors no
longer need to produce accessible Web content?</a></h2>

<p>No. Authors of Web content, and developers of Web software, have
complementary roles. For instance, to meet the needs of some users
with visual disabilities, authors must provide a text description
of an image; browsers cannot invent a meaningful description of an
image. Once an author has provided a description, browsers,
together with assistive technologies, can present the description
as either synthesized speech or braille.</p>

<p>See also the question on the <a shape="rect" href="#other-wai-gl">relation of UAAG 1.0 to other WAI
accessibility guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="target-ua" name="target-ua">What user agents does UAAG 1.0 address?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 addresses the accessibility of user agents with
multimedia capabilities, typically running on a desktop computer,
including a keyboard or keyboard equivalent, and potentially used
together with assistive technologies. User agents address in UAAG
1.0 are those designed for the general public to handle
general-purpose content in ordinary operating conditions.</p>

<p>UAAG 1.0 is not designed so that user agents on other types of
platforms (e.g., handheld devices or kiosks) will readily conform.
This document does not forbid conformance by any type of user
agent, but some requirements (e.g., implementation of certain
application programming interfaces, or <acronym>APIs</acronym>) are
not likely to be satisfied on environments other than the target
environment. Future work by the UAWG may address the accessibility
of user agents running on handheld devices, for example.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="at-role" name="at-role">What role do assistive technologies play in UAAG
1.0?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 is designed for general purpose browsers and media
players, and not for assistive technologies; so screen readers,
screen magnifiers, and other assistive technologies are not
expected to conform (though they may). The ability of conforming
user agents to communicate well with assistive technologies will
depend in part on the willingness of assistive technology
developers to follow the same standards and conventions for
interoperability. UAAG 1.0 is designed to ensure that a conforming
browser or media player communicates -- through publicly documented
interfaces -- with assistive technologies.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="plug-ins" name="plug-ins">Can plug-ins be used to satisfy requirements of
UAAG 1.0?</a></h2>

<p>Yes. UAAG 1.0 requirements may be met by any combination of
components, including plug-ins, operating system features, Web
pages, and of course built-in features of a user agent.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="certification" name="certification">Does W3C certify conformance to UAAG
1.0?</a></h2>

<p>At this time, W3C does not certify user agents for conformance.
The UAWG is developing a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/">test suite</a> that
will help people determine whether a user agent satisfies UAAG 1.0
requirements.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="icons" name="icons">How do
I use the conformance icons?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 conformance icons (or, "logos") can be part of a
conformance claim. The icons may be used anywhere, including on a
Web site, on user agent packaging, and in documentation. It is
meaningless to use a conformance icon alone, i.e., to use the icon
without an associated well-formed conformance claim.</p>

<p>For detailed information on using the conformance icons, please
refer to the <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/UAAG10-Conformance">UAAG
1.0 Conformance icons</a> page.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="which-conform" name="which-conform">Which user agents actually conform? Does W3C
maintain a list?</a></h2>

<p>At this time, W3C does not maintain a list of conforming user
agents, or a list of conformance claims.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="conflicts" name="conflicts">Do accessibility features conflict with other user
agent features?</a></h2>

<p>A user does not need every user agent feature at all times
(whether a feature related to accessibility or not); every
developer therefore offers configuration options. UAAG 1.0
emphasizes configurability to ensure that accessibility features do
not conflict with other user agent features. Furthermore, it is
expected that UAAG 1.0 requirements will improve the overall
usability of user agents; see also the question about <a shape="rect" href="#other-benefits">other benefits of UAAG
1.0</a>.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="doc-features" name="doc-features">How do I learn about the accessibility features
of a given user agent?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 requires that accessibility features be listed in the
user agent documentation. This means that any conforming user agent
must have documentation of the accessibility features. The features
may be listed in a single place (which is convenient for people
learning to use a piece of software), and/or distributed throughout
the documentation (which is useful for users seeking the accessible
approach to a known task).</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="ua-eval" name="ua-eval">How do I evaluate a user agent for conformance to
UAAG 1.0?</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Review the existing implementation reports linked from the <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/UA/">UAWG home page</a>. While these are
not comprehensive conformance reports, they are useful samples of
how evaluations are done.</li>

<li>"<a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/10/eval">How to evaluate a user
agent for conformance to UAAG 1.0</a>" explains how to get
started.</li>

<li>Use the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2002/08/eval">evaluation tool</a> to
interactively construct your evaluation.</li>

<li>Use the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20021003/uaag10-chktable">checklist
of UAAG 1.0 requirements</a> as a quick reference guide.</li>

<li>Use the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/">(draft) test suite</a>
to determine whether your user agent satisfies requirements for
specific features of a format. <strong>Note:</strong> Currently,
the test suite only includes tests for HTML 4.01 and some
multimedia requirements. The UAWG will continue to add tests, and
welcomes the contribution of tests to the UAWG.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="other-wai-gl" name="other-wai-gl">What is the relation of UAAG 1.0 to other WAI
accessibility guidelines?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 is part of a series of accessibility guidelines
published by the <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/">Web Accessibility
Initiative</a> (WAI). Each document in the series addresses a
particular aspect of making the Web more accessible. In addition to
UAAG 1.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a shape="rect" href="/TR/WCAG10/">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0</a> Recommendation explains how
to design accessible Web pages and Web sites.</li>

<li>The <a shape="rect" href="/TR/ATAG10/">Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 1.0</a> Recommendation explains how
to design accessible authoring tools. An accessible authoring tool
facilitates the creation of accessible Web content and is also
accessible to users with disabilities.</li>

<li>The <a shape="rect" href="/TR/xmlgl">XML Accessibility
Guidelines (XAG)</a> Working Draft (still in development) explains
how to design XML applications that support accessibility.</li>

</ul>

<p>These documents complement one another in order to meet the
needs of Web users with disabilities.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="other-sw-gl" name="other-sw-gl">What is the relation of UAAG 1.0 to
platform-specific guidelines?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 encourages software developers to follow the
accessibility conventions of each operating environment (e.g., when
designing the software user interface, keyboard shortcuts, and
documentation). Following these conventions increases consistency
for users and for developers of assistive technologies. Operating
environment guidelines also include information about accessibility
features (e.g., system-wide settings for color preferences) that
user agent developers can re-use rather than re-implement.</p>

<p>In some cases, UAAG 1.0 may overlap in scope with operating
environment accessibility guidelines. However, UAAG 1.0 is not
specific to any particular platform.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="section-508" name="section-508">What is the relation of UAAG 1.0 to national
legislation such as US "Section 508?"</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 has been developed by W3C, an international industry
consortium, with participation from many stakeholders. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act</a> is legislation specific to the United
States, relating to accessibility of electronic and information
technology, and includes requirements for accessibility of generic
computer software. Other countries may or may not develop similar
types of generic software accessibility guidelines. W3C's UAAG 1.0
addresses the accessibility of Web user agents in more depth, with
more specificity to the Web environment, and across more
disabilities. It is difficult to compare precisely UAAG 1.0 with
any one set of national requirements.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="policy" name="policy">Are
there any governments that refer to UAAG 1.0 in accessibility
policy?</a></h2>

<p>Not at this time. Please refer to the WAI list of international
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/">policies
relating to Accessibility</a> for more policy information.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="law" name="law">Is UAAG
1.0 a law?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 is not a law. W3C Recommendations have no legal
standing in and of themselves. However, some governments sometimes
adopt or refer to technical standards, including W3C
Recommendations, in legislation, regulations, or policies. The Web
Accessibility Initiative tracks some <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/">international policies
relating to Web Accessibility</a>.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="nb-checkpoints" name="nb-checkpoints">Does a user agent have to satisfy all the
checkpoints to conform?</a></h2>

<p>No. Because UAAG 1.0 includes features to satisfy the needs of a
variety of users and different types of software, a user agent is
not expected to meet every requirement in order to conform --
although the UAWG encourages user agent developers to satisfy as
many as possible. UAAG 1.0 defines "conformance profiles" for
different types of software. As part of a conformance claim, a
conformance profile explains which UAAG 1.0 requirements have been
met. UAAG 1.0 allows conformance claims for fewer than all
checkpoints. For instance, a claim may state that a user agent
satisfies requirements related to images and text, but not related
to video, audio, or synthesized speech. The UAAG 1.0 chapter on
conformance explains how to build a profile to indicate conformance
to fewer than all checkpoints.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="techs" name="techs">What
is the Techniques Document?</a></h2>

<p>"<a shape="rect" href="/TR/UAAG10-TECHS/">Techniques for UAAG
1.0</a>" presents ideas for satisfying the requirements of UAAG
1.0. Techniques for UAAG 1.0 is an implementor's companion to UAAG
1.0; the techniques included are informative, not normative, and
there is no conformance to the Techniques Document.</p>

<p>It is expected that the Techniques Document will be updated more
frequently than UAAG 1.0, as the UAWG becomes aware of new
technologies and new techniques for meeting the requirements of
UAAG 1.0.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="how-long" name="how-long">How long will it be until user agents
conform?</a></h2>

<p>It is difficult to predict when we will see conformance claims
about general purpose browsers and multimedia players. As of
publication of this Recommendation, the UAWG documented that nearly
all of the requirements of UAAG 1.0 had been implemented, but not
all of them in one user agent.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="spec-formats" name="spec-formats">Is the UAAG 1.0 document available in other
formats besides XHTML (Postscript, PDF, text)?</a></h2>

<p>The UAWG makes available a <a shape="rect" href="/TR/UAAG10/uaag10.html,text">text-only version</a> that is
derived from the source XHTML.</p>

<p>The UAWG no longer makes available Postscript or PDF versions,
since so many deployed browsers readily produce these formats
(e.g., you can create a Postscript version in many browsers by
printing to a file). For printing we suggest using the <a shape="rect" href="/TR/UAAG10/uaag10">single-page HTML version</a>
of the Recommendation.</p>

<p>Please note that the published XHTML version is the definitive
version of the Recommendation.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="gzip" name="gzip">Is the
gzip package broken?</a></h2>

<p>UAAG 1.0 is available as a set of files in a gzipped tar archive
or a zip archive. Your user agent may be decompressing the gzip
package on the fly, but still saving it with a <code>.gz</code>
suffix. Try removing the <code>.gz</code> suffix from your
downloaded file and then try to open.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="translations" name="translations">Has UAAG 1.0 been translated into languages
other than English?</a></h2>

<p>Please consult the <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/UA/UAAG-translations">list of translations of UAAG
1.0</a>. That page also indicates how to translate UAAG 1.0 in
coordination with W3C. W3C also maintains a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/">general list of
translations</a> of other W3C work.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The English version of the UAAG 1.0
Recommendation is the authoritative version.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="errata" name="errata">I
think there's an error or bug in UAAG 1.0. What should I
do?</a></h2>

<p>We encourage you to:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, consult the <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/UA/UAAG-errata">page of errata for UAAG 1.0</a>; your
error may already be listed there, with a solution.</li>

<li>If not listed, please report the error to
wai-uaag-editor@w3.org (<a shape="rect" href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-uaag-editor/">public
archive</a>).</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="contribute" name="contribute">What can I do to help make the Web more
accessible?</a></h2>

<p>There are a number of ways you can become involved with the Web
Accessibility Initiative, and specifically with the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your company is a <a shape="rect" href="/Consortium/Member/List">W3C Member</a>, you can request to
participate in any W3C Working Group. To participate in the User
Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, see <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/UA/howto-join-wg">how to join the UAWG</a>.</li>

<li>If your company is not a W3C Member, you should encourage them
to <a shape="rect" href="/Consortium/Prospectus/Joining">join
W3C</a>. In the meantime, you can request to participate as an
"invited expert," which implies an ongoing commitment to
participate in meetings, in mailing list discussions, and in the
completion of Working Group deliverables. Please consult the <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/UA/">UAWG home page</a> for more
information about participation as an invited expert.</li>

<li>The UAWG's mailing list is public, so you can read and
contribute to it at any time (for the purposes of helping the UAWG
do its work). See information about <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/UA/#Mail">UAWG mailing lists</a>.</li>

<li>If you are a developer, you can implement UAAG 1.0. Do not
hesitate to contact the UAWG if you have questions regarding UAAG
1.0.</li>

<li>You can become a <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/Sponsor.html">WAI
Sponsor</a>.</li>

<li>You can help <a shape="rect" href="#translations">translate</a>

UAAG 1.0 into a language other than English.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="question"><a shape="rect" id="more-info" name="more-info">Where can I find more information about
accessibility?</a></h2>

<p>We encourage you to start at the home page of W3C's <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>. You can
also start directly at the <a shape="rect" href="/WAI/Resources/">WAI Resources page</a>.</p>
