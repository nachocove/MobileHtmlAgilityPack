  <A NAME="general">1. General Questions:</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  <A NAME="whatauth">What is an authoring tool?</A>
</H3>
<P>
An authoring tool is software that people use to create Web pages and Web
sites. Authoring tools include text editors, WYSIWYG ("what you see is what
you get") editors, save-as-HTML conversion tools (word processors, spreadsheets,
presentation software, etc.), tools that generate content from databases,
multimedia editors, formating tools, and site management tools.
<H3>
  <A NAME="whatin">What is in these guidelines?</A>
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203">Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A> (<abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0) include seven general
guidelines, or principles, each of which has several checkpoints, or requirements
-- twenty-eight all together. Checkpoints are assigned one of three priority
levels. A companion
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/atag10-chklist.html">Checklist
of Checkpoints</A> sorts all checkpoints by priority, including a set of
relative-priority checkpoints, which address authoring tool support for
checkpoints in the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A>. The guidelines also include an introduction,
information about how to indicate conformance to the document, and references.
<H3>
  <A NAME="howdo">How do authoring tools support the production of accessible
  Web content?</A>
</H3>
<P>
Authoring tools can support the production of accessible Web content by
generating valid markup automatically; by checking the accessibility of content
created; by prompting the author for necessary changes; and by informing
the author how to create accessible content.
<H3>
  <A NAME="whynec">Why are these guidelines necessary?</A>
</H3>
<P>
Many of today's authoring tools create markup that is difficult for people
with disabilities to access. Since the Web has become such a key information
resource, it is important to ensure that people with disabilities can use
the Web. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 will make it much
easier for Web site developers to create sites that meet accessibility goals
established by the W3C's
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A>, and will make it possible for more people
with disabilities to create content themselves.
<H3>
  <A NAME="demand">Will there be a demand for authoring tools that implement
  these guidelines?</A>
</H3>
<P>
There is an increasing number of public and private-sector organizations
that are interested in ensuring accessibility of their Web sites, and in
some cases, governmental policies that require accessibility of certain kinds
of Web sites. These organizations are already requesting information on tools
that produce accessible content, and we expect the demand to increase.
<H2>
  <A NAME="background">2. Background:</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  <A NAME="differ">What is the difference between these guidelines and other
  Web accessibility guidelines? </A>
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines</A> explain how to design Web pages that are accessible. The
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines</A>
explain how to develop browsers and multimedia players that can be used by
people regardless of disability. The
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines</A>
explain how to develop authoring tools that make it easier to produce accessible
Web pages that conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
<H3>
  <A NAME="involve">Who has been involved in developing these guidelines?</A>
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
Working Group</A> (AUWG), which developed <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0, includes
representatives of industry, the disability community, and research
organizations. Active members during development of these guidelines included
IBM, Lotus Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, the <abbr>HTML</abbr> Writers
Guild, the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre of Canada, TRACE Research
and Development Center, Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired,
Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, and the Visually Impaired Computers
Users' Group of New York. In addition, the guidelines received review and
comment during their development by members of the Web Accessibility Initiative
(<abbr title="Web Acessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr>) Interest Group, by
W3C Member organization representatives, and by other software developers,
and all feedback was reviewed and incorporated where relevant.
<H3>
  <A NAME="learn">How does one learn more about the Web Accessibility Initiative
  (<abbr>WAI</abbr>)?</A>
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI">Web Accessibility Initiative home page</A>
includes a variety of information about WAI: resources, events, Working Group
activities, involvement opportunities, and sponsorship opportunities.
<H3>
  <A NAME="role">What is the role of W3C in Web accessibility?</A>
</H3>
<P>
W3C hosts the Web Accessibility Initiative, bringing expertise in accessibility
to the W3C Member organizations and to the Web community at large. New W3C
specifications are reviewed to ensure that they do not compromise and where
possible &nbsp;that they enhance the accessibility of the Web, ensuring that
the Web is developed to its full potential for all its users.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Availability">3. Availability of Implementations:</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  <A NAME="howsoon">How soon will there be tools available that implement these
  guidelines?</A>
</H3>
<P>
At the time of the release of <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0, every requirement of
the Guidelines has been implemented by one or more existing tools, though
no tool yet satisfies all checkpoints. In addition, authoring tool developers
are planning <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 support in upcoming products, indicated
among the <A HREF="ATAG-Testimonial.html">wide range of testimonials</A>.
<H3>
  <A NAME="bestnow">What are the best tools available now for creation of
  accessible Web sites?</A>
</H3>
<P>
Since no tool yet conforms to any <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 conformance level
at the time of <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 release, the most appropriate tool for
a given author may depend upon the needs and skills of the author in
consideration with various available tools. Does the authoring tool produce
valid markup? Tool output can be tested against
<A href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C validators</A>. Does a tool make it
easy or difficult to add accessibility information into pages, and does it
check accessibility semi-automatically? If not,
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html">existing evaluation
tools</A> can be used in conjunction with existing authoring tools to facilitate
checking. Check the <A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">WAI home page</A> for
links to updated information on implementation status of <abbr>ATAG</abbr>
1.0 in different authoring tools.
<H3>
  <A NAME="eval">If a Web site developer wanted to evaluate their current authoring
  tool, where would they start?</A>
</H3>
<P>
The Web site developer could review the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/atag10-chklist.html">Checklist
of Checkpoints for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A> and
accompanying
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-ATAG10-TECHS-20000203/">Techniques
for Authoring Tool Accessibility</A>, and compare the authoring tool against
these. This would require some familiarity with <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 as
well as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Alternatively, the Web
site developer could ask the developer of the authoring tool how soon that
product will support <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0.
<H3>
  <A NAME="w3ctools">Will W3C's own tools be conformant to these guidelines?</A>
</H3>
<P>
W3C has a testbed authoring tool/browser known as
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Amaya">Amaya</A>. The Amaya development team has
developed a workplan to implement <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0, and has begun
development on the implementations.
<H2>
  <A NAME="support">4. Support and Resources for Developers:</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  <A NAME="prior">Are the checkpoints prioritized in some way, so a developer
  will know what features are most important?</A>
</H3>
<P>
<abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 has three
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/#priorities">priority
levels</A>, which relate to the goals of the document. Priority one checkpoints
are essential to meeting the goals of the document; priority two checkpoints
are important to meeting the goals; and priority three checkpoints are beneficial
to meeting the goals. The goals of the document are that the authoring tool
be accessible; that it generate accessible content by default; and that it
encourage the creation of accessible content. In addition, some checkpoints
have relative priority, in that they reference the priority levels of checkpoints
from the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505">Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A> for which they provide implementation
guidance in authoring tools.
<H3>
  <A NAME="refmat">What kind of reference materials are available for tool
  developers who want to implement these guidelines?</A>
</H3>
<P>
The
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/atag10-chklist">Checklist
of Checkpoints for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A> that
accompanies these guidelines provides a reference listing, by priority, of
all <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 checkpoints, for assessing current product features
with regard to <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0. A W3C Note
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-ATAG10-TECHS-20000203/">Techniques
for Authoring Tool Accessibility 1.0</A> describes strategies for implementing
the checkpoints and provides references to material relevant for specific
topics such as the accessibility of multimedia content.
<H3>
  <A NAME="open">Are there any open-source materials or reference implementations
  available?</A>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-ATAG10-TECHS-20000203/">Techniques
for Authoring Tool Accessibility 1.0</A> includes references to tools, including
open-source tools, that demonstrate different strategies for meeting the
checkpoints. In addition, W3C's continuing development of its open-source
test-bed authoring
tool/browser&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Amaya">Amaya</A> has started
to implement <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0.
<H3>
  <A NAME="resource">What other resources are available to support accessibility
  of the Web?</A>
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI">Web Accessibility Initiative</A> publishes
a wide range of resources to support accessibility of the Web. Many of these
are linked from the
"<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/#Resources">resources</A>" section of the
WAI home page, such as other <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/#gt">guidelines
and techniques </A>documents; <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/#ei">easy
introductions</A> to Web accessibility (Quick Tips, Curricula, WAI Overview,
etc.); <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/#tr">technical references</A> (on
<abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, <abbr>SMIL</abbr>, and other W3C technical
reports); and a collection of pages with relevant
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/#rl">reference links</A> (policies, alternate
browsers, evaluation tools, etc.).
<H2>
  <A NAME="aboutconf">5. About Conformance:</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  <A NAME="levels">Are there different levels of conformance to
  <abbr>ATAG</abbr>?</A>
</H3>
<P>
<abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 has three levels of conformance, which correspond to its
three <A HREF="#prior">priority</A> levels. Authoring tools that satisfy
all priority one checkpoints conform at "Level-A"; authoring tools that satisfy
all priority one and two checkpoints conform at level "Double-A"; and authoring
tools that implement all three priority levels conform at level "Triple-A".
All conformance levels include relative priority checkpoints.
<H3>
  <A NAME="knowif">How will I know if a tool that I want to buy supports these
  guidelines?</A>
</H3>
<P>
An authoring tool that supports these guidelines will most likely claim
conformance at the appropriate <A href="#levels">conformance level</A>. Further
<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Conformance">information on claims of conformance
for <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0</A> is available on the Web. The
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU">Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group</A>
will continue to compile
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/1999/12/atag-implemented">implementation
information</A>, available at the time of this release in a preliminary report
only, and list authoring tools that conform to different <abbr>ATAG</abbr>
1.0 conformance levels as those tools become available and as information
about new tools becomes available to the Web Accessibility Initiative.
<H3>
  <A NAME="mustauth">Do authors have to use conformant tools to create accessible
  Web pages?</A>
</H3>
<P>
It is possible to create accessible Web pages with non-conformant tools,
by using either a text editor, WYSIWYG, or other editor, and directly applying
the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A> while creating the page. This may involve
more steps than if using a conformant tool, for instance going into the source
code to ensure that the tool is generating valid code, or performing steps
manually to check the accessibility of a page. For authors who are less familiar
with the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505">Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A>, authoring tools that conform to
<abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 may significantly facilitate production of accessible
Web sites.
<H2>
  <A NAME="conftools">6. Will Conformant Tools...</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  <A name="easy">...be easy or difficult to use?</A>
</H3>
<P>
Authoring tools are easy or difficult to use according to the level of user
experience they presume. The fact that a tool supports <abbr>ATAG</abbr>
1.0 should not directly affect its ease of use, with the exception that when
authoring accessible pages, an ATAG-conformant tool would be easier to use
than a similar tool that was not ATAG-conformant since the first tool would
automate some steps involved in making a Web page accessible.
<H3>
  <A NAME="usable">...be usable by people with disabilities?</A>
</H3>
<P>
An ATAG-conformant tool should be usable by people with disabilities since
accessibility of the tool itself is covered by the guidelines.
<H3>
  <A NAME="interesting">...allow people to create interesting Web pages?</A>
</H3>
<P>
Conformant tools will allow people to create interesting Web pages. The degree
of "interest" in a Web page can be related to the design skills of the author,
the nature of the content on the page, and the capabilities of the authoring
tool with regard to support for different markup languages
(<abbr>HTML</abbr>, SMIL, SVG, etc.) and presentation formats (CSS1, CSS2,
etc.). Whatever the capabilities of the tool, <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 provides
guidance on how to ensure that those capabilities support accessibility.
<H3>
  <A NAME="automate">...fully automate the creation of accessible content?</A>
</H3>
<P>
While ATAG-conformant tools can automate some accessibility requirements,
such as production of valid markup, they cannot automate all accessibility
requirements. For instance, they cannot automate reliable production of
alternative text for a complex image used in a specific context -- however,
they may be able to automate re-use of that alternative text the next time
that the image appears on a Web site.
<H3>
  <A NAME="interop">...produce content that works across different kinds of
  browsers?</A>
</H3>
<P>
One of W3C's primary goals is to promote the interoperability of the Web.
<abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0 emphasizes production of content that is consistent
with established Web standards, and which therefore has the greatest chance
of working across current browsers as well as the browsers of the future,
as Web technologies converge.
<H3>
  <A NAME="explain">...explain how to caption audio or describe video?</A>
</H3>
<P>
ATAG-conformant tools include help files which explain how to perform potentially
unfamiliar steps such as captioning audio or describing video for the first
time, where relevant to the type of tool. In addition, sample or tutorial
files accompanying conformant tools would include some examples of how to
author accessibility information.
<H3>
  <A NAME="verify">...provide some way to verify accessibility of Web pages?</A>
</H3>
<P>
ATAG-conformant tools are required to provide functions for validating
accessibility of the Web pages they produce.
<H3>
  <A NAME="turnoff">...allow the user to turn off prompts, alerts, checking,
  etc., if he or she didn't want to use them?</A>
</H3>
<P>
The extent of configurability depends on the type of tool. In many tools,
functions such as prompting, alerts, and validation could be adjusted or
turned off by the user; while other tools might always have accessibility
features "turned on."
<H3>
  <A NAME="knowhtml">...require the user to know much <abbr>HTML</abbr> to
  make accessible Web pages?</A>
</H3>
<P>
This depends on the type of tool. Some tools assume no knowledge of
<abbr>HTML</abbr> or other markup language, and others either require some
knowledge, or allow the user to edit source code directly when needed. With
tools that do not conform to <abbr>ATAG</abbr> 1.0, the user often must know
some <abbr>HTML</abbr> to be able to fix accessibility problems that the
tool creates.
<H3>
  <A NAME="convert">...require the user to convert their existing code?</A>
</H3>
<P>
This depends primarily on the type of tool used to produce existing source
code. A page already using valid code should not require conversion for the
purpose of accessibility, although it might require the addition of information
such as providing a summary for a table. A page containing large amounts
of inaccessible markup from a previous authoring tool could require conversion
or "repair" of the source code. Some conformant tools may make conversions
automatically; while others might reject code that is invalid.
