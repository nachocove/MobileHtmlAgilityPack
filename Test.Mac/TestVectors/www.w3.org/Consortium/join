                        <h2 id="overview">Overview of Application Process</h2>

                        <ol class="show_items"><li>Your organization completes a <a href="application">Membership Application</a>.</li><li>W3C reviews the Membership Application. If W3C approves your
    Application, you begin to enjoy the benefits of W3C Membership as soon as
    you would like.</li><li>Your organization and the W3C Hosts (MIT, ERCIM, Keio University, and Beihang University) sign a customized version of the <a href="/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">standard
    W3C Member Agreement</a>. Note that (Interim) Membership Benefits only
    begin once W3C has received signed Member Agreements from your
    organization.</li></ol>


                        <h2 id="prep">Before You Start</h2>

                        <p>Before you start the Member Application process, we recommend that you:</p>
                        <ol class="show_items"><li>Review the <a href="/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">standard W3C Member Agreement</a>. This is the legal
    contract that your organization and W3C will sign and is the basis of
    your W3C Membership fees, rights, and benefits.</li><li>Review the pages <a href="membership">about W3C
    Membership</a>, especially the <a href="membership-faq">Membership FAQ</a>.</li><li>Review the <a href="fees">applicable fees</a>. More than half of W3C's
                  operating costs are covered by Membership dues.
                  In order to promote a diverse Membership that
                  represents the interests of organizations around
                  the world, W3C fees vary depending on the annual
                  revenues, type, and location of headquarters of
                  an organization.</li></ol>

                        <h2 id="completion">Filling Out the Application</h2>

                        <p>The W3C Membership Application consists of a series of three electronic
forms. Each time you submit a form, your changes are saved at W3C. This means
that you do not have to complete the entire Application in one sitting.</p>
                        <dl><dt>Step 1</dt><dd>
                              <strong>Provide initial contact information.</strong> In Step 1, you:
      
	       <ul class="show_items"><li>Provide your name and email address. During the application
          process, W3C will send all correspondence to this email
        address.
                  </li><li>Identify the name of your organization and the country of your
          organization's headquarters. W3C Membership fees and the currencies
          used to express those fees depend on the country you select. More
          information on <a href="fees">how W3C computes
          Membership fees</a> is available.
                  </li><li>Choose the start date for your Membership benefits. This date
          will be used to determine some information shown in Step 2, such as
          the Membership fee.</li></ul>


                              <p>When you submit this form, W3C will send you an email with
      information about advancing to Step 2. Please save the email as it
      contains information you will use for the duration of the application
      process, in particular, a unique Web address (URI) for your
      Application.</p>
                           </dd><dt>Step 2</dt><dd>
                              <strong>Provide additional information about your
      organization.</strong> In Step 2, you provide additional information
      about your organization that W3C will use to prepare a customized
      version of the <a href="/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">standard W3C Member Agreement</a>.</dd><dt>Step 3</dt><dd>
                              <strong>Request W3C review of Application.</strong> In Step 3, you
      review the information you have provided (or return to Step 2 to modify
      it) and agree to certain conditions in order to receive interim Member
      benefits.
      <p>At the top of the form for Step 3, you will find a link to a
      customized <a href="/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Member Agreement</a>. Before you complete Step 3, we
      recommend that you circulate it among the appropriate people in your
      organization, especially the person who will sign the contract.</p>
                              <p>Once you have completed step three:</p>
                              <ol><li>W3C will acknowledge, by email, receipt of your Application and
          will begin to review it. If any information is incorrect or
          incomplete, W3C will contact you.</li><li>Your Application will become "read-only" to you. Any further
          changes will be made by W3C; important changes will only be made
          after discussion with you.</li></ol>
                           </dd></dl>

                        <h2 id="interim">W3C Review and Approval of Membership Application</h2>

                        <p>W3C will notify you by email when your Membership Application has been
approved (or whether there are problems with the application). The approval
notification will include:</p>
                        <ol><li>the Web address (URI) of the customized Member Agreement that resulted
    from your Membership Application.</li><li>instructions for signing the customized Membership Agreement and
    returning it to W3C.</li><li>an invoice and instructions for payment of your first Membership
  fee.</li></ol>

                        <p>Please allow 5 business days for W3C to review your completed Membership
Application. If, for any reason, W3C expects any delays in processing your
Application, requires additional information, or cannot approve your
Membership Application, we will contact you.</p>

                        <p>Summarizing the email you will receive from W3C during the application
process:</p>
                        <ol class="show_items"><li>You will receive one email after you have completed Step 1, explaining
    how to advance to Step 2.</li><li>You will receive one email after you have completed Step 3,
    acknowledging reception of your completed Membership Application.</li><li>You will receive one email after W3C has reviewed your application,
    indicating whether the application has been approved or requires
    additional discussion.</li><li>You will receive one email after W3C has received signed copies of your
    Member Agreement.</li></ol>

                        <p>
                           <strong>Note:</strong> W3C Management reserves the right to review the
eligibility of the Applicant for the organization type and fee level chosen
in the Membership Application.</p>

                        <h2 id="signing">Signing the Membership Agreement</h2>

                        <p>Once you have received notification from W3C that your Member Application
has been approved, please print two copies of the customized Membership
Agreement. Have your Contract Agent (named in Step 2 of the Membership
Application) sign both of them and return them to the address provided in
the email approval of your application. One copy will be returned to you when it is fully executed by the appropriate W3C Host.</p>

                        <p>Once W3C has received your signed Member Agreements, your Interim
Membership Benefits will either start immediately, or at the beginning of the
next quarter, according to what you requested in the Application.</p>

                        <h3>Reasons for Suspension of Interim Membership</h3>

                        <p>Your Membership formally begins once all parties have signed the
customized Member Agreement and W3C has received payment of the Membership
fee.</p>

                        <p>Your Interim Membership will be suspended (after W3C Team review) if W3C
does not receive payment of the first invoice within 45 days of the start of
your Interim Membership Benefits.</p>

                        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

                        <p>Now that you have reviewed the steps for becoming a W3C Member, we look
forward to receiving your completed <a href="application.php3">Membership Application</a>.</p>
