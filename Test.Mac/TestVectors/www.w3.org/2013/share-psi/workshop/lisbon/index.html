<h1>Lisbon Workshop: Encouraging open data usage by commercial developers</h1>
<section id="cfp">
<h2>Call For Participation</h2>
<p>The open data movement, and the PSI Directive, are promoted as being good for government transparency, 
government efficiency and economic growth. In this, the second Share-PSI 2.0 workshop, we want 
to focus on that last point. Commissioner Neelie Kroes famously said that 
<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-12-149_en.htm">data is the new oil</a>. There are 
<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/document.cfm?doc_id=1093">claims</a> that 
PSI is worth many billions of Euros to industry and that developers are itching to get their 
hands on the data, unleashing a tidal wave of creativity.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Let's look at some examples in public sector open data portals. A popular use of open 
data across Europe follows from the <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/water_protection_management/co0018_en.htm">Bathing Water Quality Directive</a>. 
Spain has <a href="http://datos.gob.es/content/balnearios-de-espana">Balnearios de España</a>, 
produced by the State Agency for Management of Innovation and Technology Tourism SA (SEGITTUR). 
The UK has its official <a href="http://environment.data.gov.uk/lab/bwq-web">Bathing Water Quality explorer</a> 
and a mobile app produced by a firm of architects (Arup) called <a href="http://www.beachselecta.co.uk/">Beach Selecta</a>. 
France has its official <a href="http://baignades.sante.gouv.fr/">bathing water quality site</a> that allows you 
to explore French bathing water quality but the data is not published separately and therefore is not used in
applications such as <a href="http://opendata.regionpaca.fr/applis/appli/vamos-a-la-playa.html">Vamos a la Playa</a>.</p>
<p>All these bathing water quality applications are free to use and, with the exception of Beach Selecta, created 
by the relevant ministry. These are a few simple examples of government efficiently providing information 
to citizens, certainly, but there's no economic stimulation here (except for the ministries' contractors). 
Hackathons, such as <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/23/flood-hack-developing-solutions/">Flood Hack</a> 
are often organised to stimulate creativity around newly opened data sets and they are certainly 
effective at doing that – but do they lead to commercial success? Well, in the case of events 
like Denmark's <a href="http://afsniti.dk/">AFSNIT</a>, the prizes are substantial 
(100,000 DKK is over €13,000) but finding examples of profitable exploitation of open data can be hard.</p>
<p>Notable examples include <a href="http://datamarket.com/">DataMarket</a>, the <a href="http://transportapi.com/">Transport API</a> 
and <a href="http://www.xpresslegal.co.uk/">Xpresslegal</a>. Sites like 
<a href="http://www.opendataforum.info/index.php/apps">Open Data Forum.info</a> list a lot of 
applications but many of these, like the bathing water examples, are not commercial. So what 
is the reality of the commercial services built on (free) open data that the PSI Directive foresees?
Companies like <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Skobbler_GmbH">Skobbler</a>, 
<a href="http://cloudmade.com/solutions/portals">Cloudmade</a>, 
<a href="https://www.enaikoon.com/en/about-us/openstreetmap/">ENAiKOON</a> and 
<a href="http://www.naviki.org/en/services/services/more-services/">Naviki</a> all make commercial 
use of a single open data source: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>, but are they
and the ones presented in these 
<a href="http://theodi.org/blog/odi-startups-who-they-are-and-what-they-do-in-60-seconds">60 second video pitches</a>
from the Open Data Institute the tip of the iceberg or the exceptions to the rule? What happens to all the 
other open data?</p>

<section id="Workshop_Aims"><h3>Workshop Aims</h3>

<img src="../../ama" width="147" height="59" alt="AMA logo" class="rightImg"/>

<p>Hosted by the Portuguese Agency for Public Services Reform, 
<a href="http://www.ama.pt/"><abbr title="Agência para a Modernização Administrativa IP">AMA</abbr></a>, the 
Lisbon workshop provides an opportunity for a wide variety of stakeholders to come together 
to discuss and build the relationship between the public and private sectors in the context of 
Europe's <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/legal-rules">revised PSI Directive</a>.</p>
<p>From the <strong>public sector</strong> we look forward to examples of successful, and perhaps 
less successful, attempts to engage with
small and big enterprise who have (re)used public sector data in their business model, and
commercial developers who (re)use open data in their products.</p>
<p>From the <strong>private sector</strong> we're seeking
case studies of commercially successful use of public sector data and to 
identify the most pressing demands 
and the barriers to greater commercial use of public sector data.</p>
<p>By considering both sides we aim to offer pragmatic advice on how to achieve a 
productive and prosperous supply and demand relationship.</p>
</section>

<section id="Workshop_Style"><h3>Workshop Style</h3>
<p>The majority of the two days of the workshop will be devoted to small groups meeting to discuss 
particular themes. Session leaders are asked to facilitate a discussion, not give a presentation. 
See the Sunlight Foundation's <a href="http://transparencycamp.org/about/tips/">Tips &amp; Tricks</a> 
page/video for more. In addition to the planned sessions, there will also be an opportunity to 
propose <i>ad hoc</i> discussions on the day (bar camp sessions).</p>
<p>The style will therefore be highly interactive discussions where participants can talk 
about ideas and possible solutions to common problems. Up to 5 sessions will be running at any one time.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be two plenary sessions that will include a small number of presentations 
of high quality work and some keynote talks from:</p>
<p><strong>Indicative list only</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Miguel Poiares Maduro, Cabinet Office Minister for Regional Development;</li>
<li>Robert Madelin, Director General of the European Commission DG CONNECT;</li>
<li>Steve Adler, IBM, co-chair of the W3C <a href="/2013/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices</a> Working Group.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="LAPSI_Track"><h3>LAPSI Track</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lapsi-project.eu/">LAPSI 2.0</a>, the European Thematic Network 
on Legal Aspects of Public Sector Information, is the perfect complement to Share-PSI 
2.0. Where Share-PSI 2.0 focusses on technical and practical measures to implement 
the revised PSI Directive, LAPSI focusses on the legal aspects. Over several 
interactive sessions, the LAPSI partners will facilitate discussions based on the project's 
outcomes, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>licence interoperability;</li>
<li>licensing guidelines;</li>
<li>good practices on institutional embedding and enforcement;</li>
<li>the PSI toolbox, a guide through the labyrinth of the regulatory framework for PSI;</li>
<li>access and data protecion;</li>
</ul>
<p>all of which are essential if PSI is to be exploited commercially.</p>

<section id="Participation"><h2>Participation</h2>
<p>Since publication of this call for participation, many proposals for
sessions and plenary talks have been received and reviewed by the programme
committee. The <a href="agenda">agenda</a> is now stable and general 
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/encouraging-open-data-usage-by-commercial-developers-tickets-14107888073">registration</a>
is open. Participation is <strong>free</strong>.</p>
<!--<p>The Share-PSI 2.0 partners invite position papers describing initiatives undertaken to 
make public sector information more attractive to commercial exploitation. Complementary 
to this, the partners are keen to hear from commercial companies that use, or would 
like to use, public sector information in their products.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which you can participate:</p><ol>
<li>Lead a <strong>session</strong>. This entails facilitating a discussion. It may
begin with a very short set up presentation but 90% of the time should be allocated for
discussion. Proposals should not be academic papers but descriptions 
of the discussion you would like to lead and the experiences you have to offer. These are expected to be 1 or 2 pages in length
and will fill slots in the Open Track.</li>

<li>Give a <strong>plenary</strong> talk. Longer papers, up to a maximum of 5 pages in length, are 
invited for consideration as the basis of a plenary presentation of which no more than 3
are expected to be presented at the workshop.</li>

<li>If you would like to <strong>attend but do not wish to lead a session</strong> or give 
a plenary presentation, please outline your interest in a short position paper. The 
intention is to make sure that participants have an active interest in the area, 
and that the workshop will benefit from their presence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Session proposals and plenary papers will be subject to review by the <a href="programme">Programme Committee</a>. 
Closely related session papers will be grouped together so that authors of selected papers will need 
to decide ahead of time who will actually lead the session, which is likely to last approximately 
one hour (see the <a href="agenda">agenda</a>).</p> -->

<p><strong>Anyone</strong> present at the workshop may propose a <a href="agenda#pitches"><strong>bar camp session</strong></a>. 
Ideas can be submitted at any time before or during the workshop.
There's no Programme Committee review - people vote with their feet on the day!</p>

<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>successful commercial exploitation of public sector data;</li>
<li>barriers to commercial exploitation of public sector information;</li>
<li>experiences of commercial/public sector interaction;</li>
<li>expectations met and unexpected outcomes of working with open data in a commercial environment.</li>
</ul>

<section id="Call_for_collocation"><h2>Call for collocation</h2>
<p>The Share-PSI 2.0 partners encourage other groups to propose sessions and perhaps hold 
face to face meetings in Lisbon during that first week of December 2014.</p>
<p>As well as LAPSI, the <a href="http://www.lider-project.eu/">LIDER project</a> is planning to
run some sessions where they'll discuss their work on creating a Linguistic Linked Data 
cloud that can support content analytics tasks of unstructured multilingual cross-media content.</p>
<p>The Lisbon workshop, with its highly interactive format across multiple tracks, plus high profile
speakers, is a perfect place to boost your project's dissemination activities.</p>
