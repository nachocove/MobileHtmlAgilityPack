<h2><a name="q1">What is SOAP Version 1.2?</a></h2>

<p>SOAP Version 1.2 is a messaging framework with a set of extensions. The
specification is in three distinct documents:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part0-20030624/">The
    Primer</a>, (or part 0), an introduction SOAP 1.2</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part1-20030624/">The
    Messaging Framework</a> (Part 1), the core specification and</li>
  <li><a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part2-20030624/">Adjuncts</a>
    (Part 2), which provides a set of extensions, including the HTTP
  binding.</li>
  <li><a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-testcollection-20030624/">Specification
    Assertions and Test Collection</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2><a name="q2">Who has implemented SOAP Version 1.2?</a></h2>

<p>The<a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/03/soap1.2implementation.html"> SOAP
Version 1.2 Implementation Report</a> has a list of implementors known to the
XML Protocol Working Group, as well as a status of their implementation. The
list is not exhaustive.</p>

<h2><a name="q3">Where can I find an introduction to SOAP Version
1.2?</a></h2>

<p>The SOAP Version 1.2 <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part0-20030624/">Primer</a> gives
a good introduction to SOAP 1.2, and is recommended reading.</p>

<h2><a name="q4">What is new in SOAP Version 1.2?</a></h2>

<p>SOAP Version 1.2 is based on a layered and extensible model.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Over <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/">400 issues</a> raised
    both in the SOAP 1.1 and early SOAP 1.2 specifications have been
  resolved.</li>
  <li>SOAP version 1.2 supports Web standards such as <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-1-20010502/">XML Schema</a>
    and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-infoset-20011024/">XML
    Infoset</a>.</li>
  <li>The "transport" layer makes it easy to switch between protocols like
    HTTP, BEEP and others to fit your application needs.</li>
  <li>Extensions and the processing of those extensions has been improved and
    clarified, to ensure more extensibility and interoperability.</li>
  <li>Error reporting has been improved.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more technical details, the SOAP Version 1.2 Part 0 (Primer) has a
complete list of changes from SOAP/1.1 to SOAP Version 1.2</p>

<h2><a name="q5">Why switch to SOAP Version 1.2?</a></h2>

<p>SOAP Version 1.2 provides more  - and proven - interoperability, support
for Web standards, and an easier way to extend and update your applications.
It also allows you to define applications that can scale better through a
more effective use of Web infrastructure  - namely with the option of using
the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part2-20030624/#soapinhttp">HTTP
binding</a>. For a more complete reply, see <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2003/06/soap11-soap12.html">From SOAP/1.1 to SOAP
Version 1.2 in 9 points</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="q6">How can I be sure my implementation is
interoperable?</a></h2>

<p>You should see the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-testcollection-20030624/">SOAP
Version 1.2 Specification Assertions and Test Collection</a>, and contact the
implementers listed in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/03/soap1.2implementation.html">implementation
report</a> to set up tests.</p>

<h2><a name="q7">Is SOAP Version 1.2 secure?</a></h2>

<p>An application is as secure as its design is. SOAP Version 1.2 may use
some security features, but in the end, like in all current  distributed
applications, it is up to the application itself to take care of security
(buffer overflow, denial of services...)</p>

<h2><a name="q8">Can I use SOAP Version 1.2 without WSDL?</a></h2>

<p>Yes, SOAP 1.2 is not dependent on WSDL (Web Services Description
Language). There are many interesting situations in which SOAP can be used
without WSDL. Indeed, early adopters of SOAP used it for many months before
languages similar to WSDL became available.</p>

<h2><a name="q9">So, when do I need WSDL?</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/">WSDL</a> is used primarily as a
means of documenting, in machine readable form, the details of particular
SOAP-based protocols.  Many WSDL-enabled tools can use these descriptions to
help you build SOAP applications. Without WSDL, you may have to tailor more
of your code by hand.</p>

<h2><a name="q10">What are my options if I want to use WSDL?</a></h2>

<p>Several options are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WSDL toolkit vendors have interim solutions. Check with them.</li>
  <li>The SOAPBuilders development community has developed interim support
    for SOAP Version 1.2 using WSDL 1.1 and some degree of interoperability
    will be achievable using that [<a
    href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/7431">link</a>]</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/">Web Services Description
    Working Group</a> in W3C will support SOAP Version 1.2 in the next
    version of WSDL (WSDL 1.2). Check with them.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="q11">Is SOAP Version 1.2 internationalized?</a></h2>

<p>SOAP Version 1.2 has provisions for internationalization, including the
ability to provide multiple error messages in different languages, encodings,
character sets. Applications themselves still have to be internationalized,
but that is a separate matter. SOAP Version 1.2 itself puts no restriction to
a particular language.</p>

<h2><a name="q12">Can I use other underlying transport protocols in SOAP
Version 1.2?</a></h2>

<p>One of the goals of SOAP Version 1.2 was to develop a clean way to change
the underlying transport. Part 2 Adjuncts defines a rather complete mapping
to HTTP, but you can define your own mapping to whatever protocol, using the
SOAP Protocol Binding Framework defined in <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part1-20030624/#transpbindframew">Part
1, Section 4.</a></p>

<h2><a name="q13">Will my SOAP Version 1.2 implementation work with SOAP/1.1
clients?</a></h2>

<p>Yes, but not directly. The client application will be notified that the
current version being used is SOAP Version 1.2. The client application may
switch to SOAP Version 1.2 for subsequent requests. <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part1-20030624/#vmfault">See Part
1, Section 5.4.7</a></p>
