<h2 id="advantages">What are the advantages of XForms?</h2>

<p>Here are the primary benefits:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>XForms improves the user experience</dt>
    <dd>XForms has been designed to allow much to be checked by the browser,
      such as types of fields being filled in, that a particular field is
      required, or that one date is later than another. This reduces the need
      for round trips to the server or for extensive script-based solutions,
      and improves the user experience by giving immediate feedback to what
      is being filled in.</dd>
  <dt>It is XML, and it can submit XML</dt>
    <dd>XForms is properly integrated into XML: it is in XML, the data it
      collects in the form is XML, it can load external XML documents as
      initial data, and can submit the results as XML. By including the user
      in the XML pipeline, it at last means you can have end-to-end XML,
      right up to the user's desktop.</dd>
  <dt>It combines existing XML technologies</dt>
    <dd>Rather than reinventing the wheel, XForms uses a number of existing
      XML technologies, such as XPath for addressing and calculating values,
      and XML Schema for defining data types. This has a dual benefit: ease
      of learning for people who already know these technologies, and the
      ability for implementors to use off-the-shelf components to build their
      systems.</dd>
  <dt>It is device independent</dt>
    <dd>The same form can be delivered <em>without change</em> to a
      traditional browser, a PDA, a mobile phone, a voice browser, and even
      some more exotic emerging clients such as an Instant Messenger. This
      greatly eases providing forms to a wide audience, since forms only need
      to be authored once.</dd>
  <dt>It is easier to author complicated forms</dt>
    <dd>Because XForms uses declarative markup to declare properties of
      values, and to build relationships between values, it is much easier
      for the author to create complicated, adaptive, forms, without having
      to resort to scripting.</dd>
  <dt>It is internationalized</dt>
    <dd>Because the data submitted is XML, it is properly
    internationalized.</dd>
  <dt>It is accessible</dt>
    <dd>XForms has been designed so that it will work equally well with
      accessible technologies (for instance for blind users) as with
      traditional visual browsers.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="new">What can I do with XForms that I can't do with old HTML
Forms?</h2>

<p>XForms can do everything that HTML Forms can do, and then some. In
particular XForms lets you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check data values while the user is typing them in.</li>
  <li>Indicate that certain fields are required, and that the form cannot be
    submitted without them.</li>
  <li>Submit forms data as XML.</li>
  <li>Integrate with Web services, for instance by using SOAP and XML
  RPC.</li>
  <li>Submit the same form to different servers (for instance a search string
    to different search engines).</li>
  <li>Save and restore values to and from a file.</li>
  <li>Use the result of a submit as input to a further form.</li>
  <li>Get the initial data for a form from an external document.</li>
  <li>Calculate submitted values from other values.</li>
  <li>Constrain values in certain ways, such as requiring them to be in a
    certain range.</li>
  <li>Build 'shopping basket' and 'wizard' style forms without needing to
    resort to scripting.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="complicated">Is XForms more complicated than HTML Forms?</h2>

<p>No. The XForms Recommendation may make it look complicated, but it is not
a tutorial on XForms; it is addressed to implementors who need to know exact
details about how to implement XForms, and so is very detailed.</p>

<p>The same form written in HTML Forms and XForms looks pretty much the same.
It is when you start to design forms that HTML wasn't designed to handle that
XForms starts to become much simpler. So XForms contains things that HTML
Forms doesn't, but that is in order to make forms creation simpler. See <a
href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2003/xforms-for-html-authors.html">XForms
for HTML Authors</a> for examples.</p>

<h2 id="browsers">Will we have to wait for new browsers?</h2>

<p>No. There are already several implementations that let you use XForms with
existing browsers, either with plugins or by transforming the forms at the
server, as well as a number of browsers that implement XForms natively.</p>

<p>There is a list of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/#implementations">XForms
Implementations</a> that contains details of many of these implementations;
an <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/09/10/xforms.html">editorial
review</a> including screen shots of some of them, can be found at
xml.com.</p>

<h2 id="pdas">Will XForms work on PDAs and mobile phones?</h2>

<p>At the time of writing XForms has been demonstrated on PDAs and mobile
phones using proxies, using the same techniques that are often used to
present web content on smaller devices. We anticipate that native XForms
clients will appear on mobile devices soon.</p>

<h2 id="servers">What servers (currently) support XForms?</h2>

<p>All of them! XForms has several new submission methods compared with HTML
Forms, but these are all standard HTTP methods for sending data over the
network. XForms can use 'PUT' to put data to a server, can talk to a SOAP or
XML RPC server, but also supports legacy formats allowing forms to work with
all existing forms servers.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who is backing XForms?</h2>

<p>The XForms working group that created XForms contains representatives from
many major computing companies, see the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2003/10/xforms-pressrelease">press-release</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2003/10/xforms-testimonial">testimonials</a> about
XForms for details. On top of this there are a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/#implementations">large number of
implementations</a> emerging. In fact XForms is the most-implemented W3C
specification ever at this stage in its life-cycle.</p>

<p>Some large user populations are beginning to emerge, including the British
Government's e-government initiative, one country's tax service, and a
country's insurance industry.</p>

<h2 id="others">Aren't other companies also coming with new forms
technologies too?</h2>

<p>That's right. Forms were the basis of the e-commerce revolution and they
are still a hot topic! However, the many companies backing XForms believe
that there are advantages in using a non-proprietary technology that is based
on common standards, and not tied to a single vendor. It means a wealth of
user agents on a variety of platforms. Furthermore, we believe that once you
have appreciated the advantages of the XForms approach -- authoring once for
multiple platforms, integration in XML, ability to 'edit' external XML
documents -- you will want no other!</p>

<h2 id="resources">What other resources are there?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms home page</a> is a
good source of information about XForms.</p>

<p>There are books about XForms appearing, and a search for "XForms" at any
well known online bookstore will reveal them.</p>

<p>There is an introduction to <a
href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2003/xforms-for-html-authors.html">XForms
for HTML Authors</a>.</p>
