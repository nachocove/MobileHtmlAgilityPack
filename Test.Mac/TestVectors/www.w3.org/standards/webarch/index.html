<a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#tag-participation">
By design</a> , five of the participants on the TAG are elected by
the members of W3C. That means that the membership of W3C have a
direct influence over the composition of the TAG and therefore over
its technical direction, priorities and mandate. In practice, this
has meant that in the past couple of&#xA0;years we have had a
significant shift&#xA0;of focus, as W3C membership has chosen to
elect candidates whose area of expertise&#xA0;is more oriented
around the browser, who have more of an interest in the
intersection between JavaScript and other Web
technologies,&#xA0;who have been signatories to the 
<a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org">Extensible Web
Manifesto</a> and who have had a strong belief that the TAG can play
a constructive role in connecting the developer community with
standards. We&#x2019;ve taken this mandate seriously and embarked in a
program of activities these past two&#xA0;years that have included
developer outreach events, &#x201C;summits,&#x201D; new findings such as the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/promises-guide">Promises
Guide</a> &#xA0;and guidelines on the use of 
<a href="http://w3ctag.github.io/capability-urls/">Capability
URLs</a>&#xA0;as well&#xA0;as working on API design with such
efforts&#xA0;as Web Audio, EME, Responsive Images and the Push
API.</p><p>Now an election cycle is starting and four of our seats are up
for election. You now have another opportunity to shape the work of
the TAG. And by &#x201C;you&#x201D; I do not only mean the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">401&#xA0;W3C
members</a> as represented by its august 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/membership-faq#ACRep">
Advisory Committee</a>. I mean &#x201C;you&#x201D; the web community at large.
The nominees are put forward and the votes are cast by W3C members.
So if you work for, or are associated with, one of these then you
have an opportunity to influence this process via your Advisory
Committee representative. If you would like to put yourself forward
for the TAG election, or if you have opinions on the the slate of
candidates, let that A.C. representative&#xA0;know. If you are not
associated with a W3C member you can still get involved. Reach out
to someone you know who is associated with a W3C member to let them
know what you think is most&#xA0;important for the long-term
direction of the Web or to put yourself forward for nomination.
Write a blog post. Tweet and mention 
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/w3ctag">@w3ctag</a> . Get involved
in our discussions on our 
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/">public
mailing list</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/w3ctag">on Github</a>.&#xA0;The W3C, as
a trustee&#xA0;of web technologies and standards holds this
position in trust of the wider web community, and the TAG, as
steward of Web architecture needs to do&#xA0;so as well.</p><p>The nomination period ends on the 30
<sup>th</sup>of November and the election itself will take place in
late December and early January. Thanks for your help and
support!</p></div>

<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>[Post amended to further elaborate on how the Report Card fits
into the rest of the TAG's Work]</p><p>The TAG is chartered to work on the&#xA0;architecture of the
web. &#xA0;As the Web continues to evolves from a Web documents to
a Web of distributed applications, and as Javascript programming
has become such an important part of web development, it&#x2019;s becoming
more important than ever to focus on how we add new features to the
web and how we extend existing features. Last year, some members of
the TAG collaborated with others in the community in some thinking
which resulted in the 
<a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org">Extensible Web
Manifesto</a> . The ideas promoted by this vision of the future,
which include exposing low-level capabilities and 
<a href="http://infrequently.org/2012/04/bedrock/">doing so in a
layered way</a> , have influenced a lot of the work of the TAG,
particularly around our 
<a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews">
specification&#xA0;reviews</a>.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve had feedback at some of our developer meet-ups this year
that people would like a better 
<del>idea</del>&#xA0;articulation from us of the design principles
the TAG is employing when we review specs. We&#x2019;ve also had a lot of
questions about how the views in the Extensible Web Manifesto
relate to the TAG&#x2019;s current work. We thought one way to address
these questions would be to publish a review of (what we see as)
some key standards and how they measure up against the ideals of
extensibility. A kind of &#x201C;Report Card&#x201D; on the state of the
extensible web that could simultaneously provide some feedback to
individual standards efforts and show the community some examples
of what we&#x2019;re talking about. The 
<a href="http://extensiblewebreportcard.org">Extensible Web Report
Card</a> is the result and it&#x2019;s a document that we hope to continue
to update as new information becomes available. Have a look and

<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>The 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-encoding-20140916/">Encoding
specification</a>has been published as a Candidate Recommendation.
This is a snapshot of the WHATWG document, as of 4 September 2014,
published after discussion with the WHATWG editors. No changes have
been made in the body of this document other than to align with W3C
house styles. The primary reason that W3C is publishing this
document is so that HTML5 and other specifications may normatively
refer to a stable W3C Recommendation.</p><p>Going forward, the Internationalization Working Group expects to
receive more comments in the form of implementation feedback and
test cases. The Working Group
<br />believes it will have satisfied its implementation criteria
no earlier than 16 March 2015. If you would like to contribute test
cases or information about implementations, please send mail to 
<a href="mailto:www-international@w3.org">
www-international@w3.org</a>.</p><p>The utf-8 encoding is the most appropriate encoding for
interchange of Unicode, the universal coded character set.
Therefore for new protocols and formats, as well as existing
formats deployed in new contexts, this specification requires (and
defines) the utf-8 encoding.</p><p>The other (legacy) encodings have been defined to some extent in
the past. However, user agents have not always implemented them in
the same way, have not always used the same labels, and often
differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of
encodings. This specification addresses those gaps so that new user
agents do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations and
existing user agents can converge.</p></div>

the evening of the 22nd of July, will be hosted by Akamai and
organized by the BostonJS meetup group. Thanks to both Akamai and
BostonJS for helping us out!</p><p>As with our previous TAG developer meet-ups, this will be a
pretty simple format. We&#x2019;ll get the TAG members up on stage for a
panel discussion about some of the topics we&#x2019;re covering. We&#x2019;re
going to let you know what we&#x2019;re working on, answer questions and
hopefully engage in some spirited discussion. The event is open to
anyone interested in web architecture, web development, web
standards and the future of web tech. It&#x2019;s free to attend and you
do not have to already be a member of BostonJS to attend (though
you will have to join that meetup group if you want

<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/">Version 7.0
of the Unicode Standard</a>is now available, adding 2,834 new
characters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols for
the Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji
(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-used
and historic scripts, as well as character additions to many
existing scripts. These additions extend support for written
languages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,
and Africa. See the link above for full details.</p><p>Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in
long-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdings
fonts.</p><p>Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. New
property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to
rendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joining
behavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of the
syllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,
the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can be
significantly improved.</p><p>Unicode character properties were extended to the new
characters. The old characters have enhancements to Script and
Alphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. There
were also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as well
as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable
implementations.</p><p>Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained in
synchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version
7.0. These will be released at the same time:</p><p>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/tr10-30.html">UTS #10,
Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>&#x2014; the standard for sorting Unicode
text
<br />

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-encoding-20140603/">
Encoding</a>has been published.</p><p>While encodings have been defined to some extent,
implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,
have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing
with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. This
specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new
implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding
implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations
can converge.</p><p>The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version as
of the date of its publication, intended to provide a stable
reference for other specifications. We are hoping for people to
review the specification and send comments about any technical
areas that need attention (see the Status section for details).</p><p>Please send comments by 
<strong>1 July 2014</strong>.</p></div>

<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>The battle for web security and privacy is fought at many
levels. Sometimes common practice in web application design can
lead to data leakage with untended consequences for users. A good
example of this came up recently where confidential files shared
through common web-based document sharing services were being
exposed unintentionaly to third parties because the private URLs
used to share them had been unintentionally leaked.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">

</blockquote><p></p><p>URLs that allow a user to access an otherwise privileged
resource or information are called&#xA0;
<em>Capability URLs</em>, and while they&#xA0;can be powerful, they
can also cause potential problems when used improperly.</p><p>TAG member Jeni Tennison has been working on a draft defining
the space of capability URLs and outlining some good practices for
usage. We think this document should be useful for web builders who
are thinking about incorporating this pattern into their
applications. We think it&#x2019;s pretty good, but we need your feedback
before we finalize it and release it as a TAG finding.</p><p>The draft may be found here:
