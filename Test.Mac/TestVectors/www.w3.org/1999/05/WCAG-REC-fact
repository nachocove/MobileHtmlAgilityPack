<h2>
  <a name="what-are" id="what-are" shape="rect">1. What are the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT" shape="rect">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0</a>" are a W3C specification providing guidance on accessibility
of Web sites for people with disabilities. They have been developed by the
W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI" shape="rect">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>. The
specification contains fourteen guidelines which are general principles of
accessible design. Each guideline is associated with one or more checkpoints
describing how to apply that guideline to particular features of Web pages.
An appendix to the guidelines,
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/full-checklist.html" shape="rect">List of
Checkpoints for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>" presents
the checkpoints sorted by priority for easy reference. These guidelines not
only make pages more accessible to people with disabilities, but also have
the side benefit of making pages more accessible to all users, or to users
using different browsers or one of the emerging handheld or voice-based
computers.
</p>
<h2>
  <a name="conformance" id="conformance" shape="rect">2. What are the "priorities" and "conformance levels,"
  and how does one use the logos?</a>
</h2>
<p>
Each checkpoint is assigned one of three
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#priorities" shape="rect">priority
levels</a>. Priority one is for checkpoints that a developer must satisfy
otherwise some groups of people will be unable to access information on a
site; priority two a developer should satisfy or else it will be very difficult
to access information; priority three a developer may satisfy otherwise,
some people will find it difficult to access information.</p>
<p>
The specification defines three
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#Conformance" shape="rect">conformance
levels</a>" to facilitate reference by other organizations. Conformance level
"Single-A" includes priority one checkpoints; "Double-A" includes priority
one and two; "Triple-A" includes priority one, two and three.</p>
<p>
For those whose pages follow the guidelines,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance" shape="rect">logos</a> are available
which can be placed on their site to show conformance. See question 13 for
information on partially automated checkers to help in assessing sites.
</p>
<h2>
  <a name="audience" id="audience" shape="rect">3. Who are these guidelines written for?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The guidelines are written for a variety of audiences--people who are designing
Web sites; people who are checking existing Web sites for accessibility;
organizations that wish to require a given level of accessibility for their
Web sites; and others who are interested in ensuring that people with
disabilities can access information on the Web.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="need" id="need" shape="rect">4. Why are these guidelines needed? Why are they important?
  </a>
</h2>
<p>
People with different kinds of disabilities can experience difficulty using
the Web due to a combination of barriers in the information on Web pages,
and barriers in the "user agents" (browsers, multimedia players, or assistive
technologies such as screen readers or voice recognition).</p>
<p>
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines deal specifically with reduction
of barriers on Web pages. For some people with disabilities, barriers can
mean lack of access to information needed for educational programs; lack
of access to employment-related information or workplace intranets; lack
of access to information on civic activities or programs; inability to
participate in E-Commerce; or prevent lack of access to information on the
Web in general.</p>
<h2>

  <a name="demographics" id="demographics" shape="rect">5. How many people are affected by issues of Web
  accessibility?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The percentage of people with disabilities in many populations is between
10% and 20%. Not all disabilities affect access to information technologies
such as the Web (for instance, difficulty walking, or a heart condition,
would not affect Web access) but many do.</p>
<p>
Just as with other parts of the population, not all people with disabilities
have access to the Web. But the number of people using the Web is steadily
increasing, and for people with disabilities access to this technology is
sometimes even more critical than for the general population which may have
an easier time accessing traditional sources of information such as print
media.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="barriers" id="barriers" shape="rect">6. What are examples of some common barriers on Web
  pages?</a>
</h2>
<p>
These guidelines address barriers in Web pages which people with physical,
visual, hearing, and cognitive/neurological disabilities may encounter. Common
accessibility problems on Web sites include: images without alternative text;
lack of alternative text for imagemap hot-spots; misleading use of structural
elements on pages; uncaptioned audio or undescribed video; lack of alternative
information for users who cannot access frames or scripts; tables that are
difficult to decipher when linearized; or sites with poor color contrast.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="usability" id="usability" shape="rect">7. How will these guidelines affect usability and appearance
  of sites for non-disabled users? </a>

</h2>
<p>
Accessible Web sites can be just as creatively designed as inaccessible sites.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines address how to make a large variety
of Web features accessible, rather than recommending that sites be dull or
boring. The goal is to ensure that all kinds of Web sites, including multimedia,
work well for all users. In general, accessible Web sites don't need to be
designed to be very different. They just need to be designed to be flexible;
flexible so that users can operate them in different ways (with keyboard
and mouse), and flexible so that they transform gracefully into intelligible
and useful pages if particular technologies are not supported, or cannot
be used by particular users or browsers.</p>
<p>
Many features of the guidelines will actually improve usability of Web sites
for non-disabled users, by ensuring that sites are more easily navigable,
and that they can be accessed through a variety of different kinds of devices
rather than only a traditional graphical desk-top browser.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="text" id="text" shape="rect">8. Why don't the guidelines recommend using text-only pages?</a>
</h2>
<p>
Text-only pages should not be necessary to ensure accessibility of Web pages
that follow the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines," except in very rare
cases. In fact, text-only pages are frequently counterproductive to accessibility
since they tend to be kept less up-to-date than "primary pages," or in some
cases leave out information that is on primary pages.</p>
<p>
Many sites that have made a commitment to accessibility in the past have
used text-only pages as a solution; however, by following these guidelines
it should be unnecessary in almost all cases, or even inadvisable, to set
up and maintain a separate set of text-only pages.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="cost" id="cost" shape="rect">9. Does it cost more to make a site accessible?</a>

</h2>
<p>
Designing a new site to be accessible should not add significantly to development
cost. Some aspects of accessibility, such as use of style sheets, can actually
reduce the costs of maintaining or updating sites, and this benefit should
increase over time as style sheets are more evenly implemented in browsers
and available as an authoring strategy in authoring tools.</p>
<p>
For existing sites, the ease or difficulty of making sites accessible depends
on a variety of factors, including the size of a site, the complexity of
a site, and the authoring tool that was used to make a site. Periodic upgrades
or reviews of sites can be good opportunities to review the accessibility
of sites. When compared with the broader audience that a site is available
to, and the greater usability for other users as well, accessible sites can
be cost-effective.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="authoring" id="authoring" shape="rect">10. Are some authoring tools better for making accessible
  sites than others?</a>
</h2>
<p>
Key features to look for in Web authoring tools include production of valid
HTML and CSS, support for key accessibility features in those specifications,
and user-configurable prompting, alerts, validation and help for accessible
authoring. Look for this information in product literature, or enquire of
the authoring tool developer. For more information on authoring tool
accessibility, see the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS" shape="rect">Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="required" id="required" shape="rect">11. Will these guidelines become a requirement? Are there
  legal consequences for not making accessible pages?</a>

</h2>
<p>
These guidelines are a specification developed by the W3C, an international,
vendor-neutral industry consortium, and have been developed under W3C process.
W3C is not a legislative body and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
specification is not a regulation. The guidelines may be informally or formally
adopted by different kinds of organizations to clarify what level of
accessibility that organization requires for particular Web sites. If you
would like to learn more about specific laws or policies in different countries
which have bearing on accessibility requirements for Web sites, some of these
are available in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy" shape="rect">policy
references</a> section of the WAI site. Please contact the relevant legal
authority for more details on obligations and/or enforcement.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="supporting" id="supporting" shape="rect">12. What supporting resources are available for using
  these guidelines?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The two most important documents for using the guidelines are linked directly
from the guidelines themselves. The
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/full-checklist.html" shape="rect">List of
Checkpoints</a>," an appendix to the guidelines, groups the checkpoints by
priority and type for ease of reference. The
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth-tech.html" shape="rect">Techniques</a>"
document explains how to mark-up different accessibility features in various
mark-up languages.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the Web Accessibility Initiative International Program Office's
work includes education and outreach activities. As a result, WAI frequently
adds resources which may be helpful in training, reference, or on-line
instruction. There is a very short
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips" shape="rect">Quick Tips</a>" reference
card available in a business-card sized format, providing reminders of key
concepts in the guidelines. There are
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/#Resources" shape="rect">technical references</a> on the
accessibility features in HTML and CSS. There is a reference list of browsers
which links to information on access features of different browsers. At the
time of this release WAI is developing an on-line curriculum to accompany
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These and more resources are available
from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI" shape="rect">WAI home page</a>.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="tools" id="tools" shape="rect">13. Are there tools that can help me? Can I test the
  accessibility of my site?</a>
</h2>
<p>
There are an increasing number of tools that can help in designing or evaluating
accessibility of sites. Around the time of this release,
"<a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby" shape="rect">Bobby</a>," which is an accessibility
checker developed by the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST), will
be updated to perform an automated on-line test of many of the checkpoints
that are part of the "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT" shape="rect">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>." Such accessibility checkers can often
help with an initial identification of barriers on a site. Because no tool
can perform a complete automated test of accessibility, and because false
positives and false negatives are possible on some sites, claims of a particular
conformance level must rely on manual checking as well. In using any evaluation
tool or logo, including <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance" shape="rect">WAI's
logos</a>, it is important to examine what document version the tool or logo
is synchronized with, and any additional information about how it is intended
to be used.
</p>
<p>
Additional tools under development include tools to help retrofit sites and
plug-ins to assist legacy browsers in properly rendering newer mark-up. WAI
conducts working and interest groups focusing on evaluation and repair tools,
and helps coordinate the efforts of developers involved in building various
tools to help with accessibility.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="important" id="important" shape="rect">14. What is the most important thing to understand in
  terms of making a site accessible?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The most important thing to understand in terms of making a site accessible
is that people use the Web in very different ways. A site should therefore
present information in a way that people can access it regardless of what
kind of hardware or software they are using, and regardless of how they navigate
through a site. Web designers cannot assume that everyone uses the same kinds
of devices the same way.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="stable" id="stable" shape="rect">15. Will the guidelines be stable across evolving Web
  technologies?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are designed to be both
forwards-compatible and backwards-compatible to the greatest extent possible
within the context of evolving Web technologies. Within the document, the
fourteen guidelines focus on principles of accessible design and are abstract
enough to be stable over time. Each set of checkpoints associated with a
particular guideline is specific to a particular feature of Web pages, but
still general to a variety of mark-up and presentation languages, and therefore
expected to be relatively stable over time. Certain checkpoints include the
phrase "until user agents..." because, as browsers and assistive technologies
such as screen readers evolve, they will be able to automatically handle
certain items that currently create barriers on pages.</p>
<p>

The separate
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth-tech.html" shape="rect">Techniques</a>"
document, which is not part of the normative guidelines document, is specific
to individual mark-up languages, and will be updated more frequently as
technologies evolve.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="involved" id="involved" shape="rect">16. Who has been involved in developing these
  guidelines?</a>
</h2>
<p>
As Members in an international industry consortium, W3C 's 300+
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List" shape="rect">Member organizations</a>
have had frequent opportunities to review and comment on the guidelines as
they have evolved, and some Member organizations have participated directly
in the Web Content Guidelines Working Group, or in the WAI Interest Group
which provides on-going discussion and input to WAI working groups on Web
accessibility needs and solutions. In addition W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative
provides a forum for disability organizations, accessibility research centers,
and government to participate with industry representatives under W3C process.
Participation in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines has included
representation from all of these areas, with extensive international
participation. As a W3C Recommendation, this specification has undergone
formal review by W3C Member organizations and all comments raised have been
addressed.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="examples" id="examples" shape="rect">17. What Web sites are already using these guidelines?
  Can I see examples?</a>

</h2>
<p>
The release of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/#About" shape="rect">Recommendation</a> signified its
stabilization. WAI has received commitments from a variety of organizations
who plan for their sites to conform with the guidelines. Many sites are
expressing interest in conforming at the "Double-A" level , meaning all priority
one and two checkpoints. As sites implement the guidelines, WAI will provide
links to a sampling of sites where there is a commitment to maintain at least
a Double-A conformance rating. Please visit the WAI home page for more
information.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="other" id="other" shape="rect">18. How are these guidelines related to the other WAI guidelines,
  and other WAI work?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines address one aspect of the accessibility
equation -- how accessible is the content on a site. A second part of the
equation is the accessibility of browsers, which WAI is addressing that through
a set of "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT" shape="rect">User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines</a>." A third part of the equation is accessibility of the authoring
tools used to develop sites, which is addressed through the
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS" shape="rect">Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guidelines</a>." If authoring tools become more supportive of accessible
authoring, it will greatly facilitate the accessible content creation.
</p>
<p>
In addition to guidelines development, WAI also works internally within W3C
on ensuring that the technologies of the Web, such as HTML, CSS, SMIL, XML,
DOM, etc., support accessibility. WAI coordinates with other organizations
to develop tools which can assist in evaluation, and retrofitting pages and
providing proxy solutions to support accessibility. WAI has an active education
and outreach effort, and some activity coordinating with research and development
which can affect future Web access.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="more" id="more" shape="rect">19. How does one learn more about accessibility and WAI?</a>
</h2>
<p>
The WAI home page, at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI" shape="rect">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>, has up-to-date
information on all the resources of the Web Accessibility Initiative. There
are resource and reference areas which are updated frequently; lists of upcoming
events; links to WAI's many working groups and interest groups; and an overall
interest group for general discussion of Web accessibility issues. There
are a great many organizations doing excellent work in the area of Web
accessibility, and many of these participate in WAI. WAI's reference links
provide a start to finding many of these organizations.</p>
<h2>
  <a name="W3Crole" id="W3Crole" shape="rect">20. What is the role of W3C in Web accessibility?</a>
</h2>
<p>

<a href="http://www.w3.org" shape="rect">W3C</a>'s mission is to promote the evolution
and interoperability of the Web. The Web Accessibility Initiative, hosted
by the W3C, is an essential aspect of the work needed to promote the universality
of the Web.</p>

<h2>
  About the Web Accessibility Initiative
</h2>
<p>
W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), in partnership with organizations
around the world, is pursuing accessibility of the Web through five complementary
activities: ensuring that the core technologies of the Web support accessibility;
developing guidelines for page authoring, user agents, and authoring tools;
developing evaluation and repair tools for accessibility; conducting education
